    "description": "With components in Webflow, you can reuse any element and all its child elements in your project to achieve speeds that rival Usain Bolt\u2019s. How is this different from using classes? You\u2019re not just changing the styling, you can add or reorder elements inside your component and that will affect all other instances of that component. You can also override content in all instances of a component, so changes in that component won\u2019t affect the others.\nNow, you can nest components within other components \u2014 just like \u201cInception\u201d (2010). Except, instead of dreams, we\u2019re going deeper into components.

    "description": "In the world of web design, changes are frequent. A change here, a change there...before you know it, you've plagiarized Slack.com.\n\nBut you shouldn't do that. You should create your own thing. And when you notice something's a bit off with your design, it helps to have that perfect backup \u2014 a restore point from which you can pick up where you left off. It's good for you, it's good for Slack, and people will respect you more at work and at home when you frequently back your projects up.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll show you how to quickly create restore points in Webflow: Command-Shift-S on macOS or Control-Shift-S on Windows. Type out a clever name for your backup, and press Return. Viola. Now you have a backup.\n\nWant to restore and revert to a previous version? Click the Settings panel on the left side of the Webflow Designer, click Backups, and select the backup you want. If you press the three little dots (...), you can access options to Restore or Rename your backup. Even better, you can preview backups at any time by pressing the little eyeball button. It's pure magic, because it opens that restore point in a new tab.\n\nWhile you're testing all of this, do a search for Anne-Sophie Mutter and watch some of her incredible violin performances on YouTube. You might just find that both your focus and design inspiration increase dramatically.\n\n----------\r\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\r\n\r\nhttps://webflow.com\r\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\r\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

Add padding to the Link block on all four sides (hold down Shift to do this at once!)\n\nAnd as a bonus step, with the Link block selected, you can adjust your typography settings to remove the default blue color and the underline to give it a more modern look.\n\nClone the button here: https://webflow.com/website/apple-gradient-border\n\nExplore more about background and spacing in our 101 Crash Course on Webflow University: https://university.webflow.com/courses/webflow-101-crash-course\n\n----------\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\nJoin the Webflow Community: https://webflow.com/community\n\nhttps://webflow.com\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

    "description": "Imagine this: you add new elements to your site and, by default, they're all placed in the top left corner. That's web design for you. Using padding and margin to center multiple elements is a recipe for disaster when it comes to responsive design. And things like text alignment and transforms lead to other inheritance issues.\n\nInstead, with the power of flexbox, we're able to have full control of our alignment and justification properties. With the parent element selected (whether it\u2019s a Div block or a Container or a Section), apply the flexbox display property. Suddenly, layout superpowers are unlocked.\n\nWith the click of two buttons, you can align and justify your elements perfectly within the center of its parent element. That's it. No need to individually position your elements using absolute positioning or making tedious adjustments with padding, margin, and gaffer tape. \n\nBut flexbox doesn't stop there \u2014 with these new superpowers, you're able to achieve any type of two-dimensional layouts, such as card designs, a tags wrapper, even fixing the alignment on HBOMax.com \u2014 we teach all of this with our lesson on flexbox: http://wfl.io/learn-flexbox\n----------\r\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\r\n\r\nhttps://webflow.com\r\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\r\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

    "description": "With CSS classes, you're able to create unique styling changes. Making manual style changes to each and every element is tedious and time-consuming. Base classes are the main way to quickly create consistent styles across your website. If you make changes to one base class, it affects all base classes, because classes save styling information that you can apply to as many elements as you want throughout your website.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. You can use combo classes to build upon your base classes. That's because a combo class references the original base class.\n\nYou can also use global classes to bring a specific style to any class in your website. Global classes are specific styles to a wide range of elements.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll cover these three types of classes, which will grant you the knowledge and superpowers to create your websites exponentially faster than before.\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:41 - Create and apply classes\n01:36 - Edit classes\n02:18 - Remove classes\n02:53 - Duplicate classes\n04:23 - Combo classes\n07:39 - Global classes\n14:02 - Recap\n\nLearn more about classes on Webflow University: https://university.webflow.com/lesson/web-styling-using-classes\n\n\n----------\r\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\r\n\r\nhttps://webflow.com\r\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\r\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

    "description": "As previously seen on Apple's iPad page, horizontal scrolling fully engages visitors by using a unique interaction that changes their scrolling experience from vertical to right to left. Scrolling can also be achieved using the up and down arrow keys (spacebar for just scrolling down).\n\nBut, here\u2019s the secret \u2014 it\u2019s not horizontal scrolling. It\u2019s vertical scrolling with an interaction that moves elements in our viewport as we scroll through our project. There are five parts to a horizontal scroll effect: the track (this holds everything and serves as the trigger for the horizontal movement interaction), the camera (which is positioned sticky to the viewport as the content scroll through), the frame (which holds all of our content and aligns them horizontally), the content, and the interaction.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll teach you how to make a horizontal scrolling interaction with these steps:\n\n00:00 \u2014 Introduction\n00:52 \u2014 Create the \u201cTrack\u201d Section\n01:33 \u2014 Set up the \u201cCamera\u201d Div block\n02:40 \u2014 Structure the \u201cFrame\u201d Div block\n03:25 \u2014 Add items\n05:05 \u2014 Configure the interaction\n07:50 \u2014 Configure the interaction on tablet and mobile devices for accessibility\n09:24 \u2014 Recap\n\nRead about it \u2192 http://university.webflow.com/lesson/horizontal-scrolling\n\nClone the project \u2192 https://webflow.com/website/Cloneable-custom-horizontal-scroll-interaction\n\n----------\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\nJoin the Webflow Community: https://webflow.com/community\n\nhttps://webflow.com\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

But with great power comes great responsibility. Without understanding development best practices, atomic component design, and the processes that need to surround your workflow, your projects will quickly descend into a spaghetti string of unmaintainable legacy (no)code. This is a professional developer's guide to the \"no code\" development workflow.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNo Code Conf 2019 | Brought to you by Webflow\n\nThe no-code revolution is here \u2014 and the first conference celebrating its future and some of its greatest makers was, in fact, televised. Catch inspiring talks from no-code movement leaders like Vlad Magdalin, Hiten Shah, Brianne Kimmel, Pablo Stanley, and many more.\n\nReady to join the no-code revolution?

Today, people who write code make up only 0.25% of the world's population, and coding is still a major requirement when creating something custom for the web. But what if we created web design software that didn't require expert knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Vlad argues that it would help democratize access to this powerful new medium that is the internet.",

For example, a Section could contain a Div block that could contain a Heading, Paragraph and Button. You can view this element hierarchy in the Navigator and learn more about element hierarchy: http://wfl.io/webflow-element-hierarchy\n\nIn the Webflow Designer, you can visually select these elements on the canvas and style them however you want in the Style panel. But what if there was a way to style multiple elements on a page without your cursor leaving the Style panel?\n\nUsing the keyboard arrows, you can quickly select between elements and their child elements on the canvas. The up arrow selects an element\u2019s parent, the down arrow selects an element\u2019s child, and the left and right arrows select between sibling elements on the same level. \n\nCheck out our full list of keyboard shortcuts in the Designer: http://wfl.io/webflow-keyboard-shortcuts\n----------\r\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\r\n\r\nhttps://webflow.com\r\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\r\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

It\u2019s particularly common among creative professionals. \n \nThose with impostor syndrome experience symptoms of general anxiety, ongoing stress, and persistent workaholism to offset a fear of being exposed as a fraud. And it\u2019s worse for creatives who constantly receive subjective criticism and assessments of their work, and for those in marginalized identity groups who face greater barriers to advancement and pressures of being the only one in the room.\n \nIn this workshop, Kate Purmal, the author of the new book COMPOSURE: The Art of Executive Presence, will review the behaviors, causes, and triggers associated with impostor syndrome, and share ways to overcome these persistent patterns with a simple \u201cbrain hack\u201d to create more calm and cultivate self confidence.\n\nKate Purmal, (she/her), former tech CEO, board director, business advisor, coach, and author, Kate Purmal \nIn addition to board directing, business advising, and more, Kate is a Senior Industry Research Fellow at Georgetown University and a lecturer at University of Michigan Ross.
