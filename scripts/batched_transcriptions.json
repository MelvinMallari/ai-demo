Since this white background is pure white and the stuff inside of it is pure black, I can just select this white div and set its blending mode to lighten. And boom!

I may not be able to influence other people's lives the way I can now.

No transferring sites back and forth, no sharing web flow passwords. You can just make whatever changes you need to make for your client. In this lesson, we're going to show how to transfer a site to our client's workspace. We'll then show how that client can invite us as an agency or freelancer to their workspace, to the client's workspace, and then finally, we'll go through how we can access their workspace as a guest. Part one, transfer the site. By the way, in this example, I built my client's website in my workspace, and now I'm ready to transfer it to their workspace. Once I do, they can invite me as a guest and I can continue to work on it. Let's find the site I want to transfer, which we only have to do one time, and we'll go over and open up our site settings. All we have to do is go over and transfer. Now remember, once you transfer a site, you will no longer have access to it on your workspace. Let's type our client's email address, check it for accuracy, and then transfer. So what happens now? Well, if your client has a Veflacount, then once they accept the transfer, that site will now be in their workspace. And if they don't have a workspace account, they'll be able to create one, and the site will be in their workspace once they do. That's transferring. Next, we'll need our client to invite us to their workspace as a guest. Now I'll show exactly how it looks on the client's site. To be really clear, this is not what the agency or freelancer will see, this is what my client will see. We also included a separate video, which you can share directly with your client that shows exactly how to do this. Okay, what does our client need to do? Our client will go into their webflow dashboard. Oh, look, there's the site I just transferred to my client. If they don't have a Veflacount, they'll need to create one. But from the dashboard, they'll go to workspace settings. And over in members, they'll have the option we can see right here, to invite an agency or freelancer guest. They'll type your email as the agency or freelancer being invited as a guest and invite. That's how your client can invite you to their workspace as a guest. Part three, let's finish this and get into our client's workspace. And by the way, I'm switching my demo back to being the agency or freelancer. So first, you're in your dashboard. You'll see a message here at the top of your workspace page. But just in case, you'll also receive an invitation email. What is our goal? Our goal is to press view invitation in our dashboard. And we can just accept. And you know what? I'm now a guest in my client's workspace. So what does that mean? Here, I'll have full design access to all the sites and all the folders in my clients workspace. Same with integrations and templates and the editor. I can update the data settings or do whatever I need to do. But I won't have access to any of their sensitive workspace account settings like billing or workspace member management. So let's recap. You can be a guest in your clients of a full workspace by transferring the site to them and then having them invite you as a guest. Once you receive that invitation, you can accept it and now you have access to that workspace. So you can make whatever updates or changes you need to. And that's agency or freelancer guest in Webflow.",

    "text": " Okay, so far in this course we've covered among other things, getting clients, creating proposals, valuing our work, and a gripping 21-minute summary of how Star Trek first contact reimagined the zombie genre, a topic, greener promised yet again not to cut from this course. And what we're doing here is taking the concepts we've covered so far and preparing for our first scheduled client meeting, because we want to prepare for client interactions like we would a debate. And that kind of preparation helps us stay focused. And of course, the better we prepare, the less likely we'll be caught off guard. So we'll break this into four parts, scheduling the first meeting, prepping the right questions, planning to give the right answers, and then we'll go through the actual interaction with Rebecca from Hayes Valley Interior Design. The thing that's different between debate prep on a political stage and negotiation prep with a client is in most ways you're not adversaries. Our goal is to empathize with them and answer their questions respectfully, because once you've sent out proposals to potential clients you'll often get responses. And how you do this is different with everyone. Some people prefer to talk over the phone, some over a video chat, some people want to meet in person, and there's no right or wrong way to do it. In the last part of this course, we set up a call with Rebecca. Why? Because one of the best things to organize your thoughts and make sure you have your research down before, any type of formal interaction with the client is to schedule. If you get a call or an email wanting to learn more, sometimes we immediately jump at the chance. But if we slow down and offer to schedule a short call to talk about what they're looking to achieve, that gives us time to prep and organize. And it's a good signal to your potential client that you value and respect your own time. Since the call set for later this morning at 1030, that gives us a pretty short window to prep. But what we need to prep isn't just questions our potential client might ask us. We need to prep questions to ask our potential client, and that's the key. The goal of this call isn't to sell them on our ability to work for them. The goal of this call is to go even deeper, to better understand their business. Because so far, we only have the information we found ourselves. This is a great opportunity. Again, the better we understand their needs, the needs of their business, the better we can recommend a course of action. This is we can offer them. Fortunately, we already have a foundation. The first questions come from the proposal. How do clients find them? What happens when clients get to their site? And how can we, as a freelancer, help them out? Up until now, our research was mainly guessing based on what we could find. So the questions we ask have to start where that research ends. Some of our research is based on assumptions. What we need to do is build on them. Just like CarePlus, which we covered earlier in the course, we're going to ask questions of our potential client to understand not how it is, but how they want it to be. The very act of calling or emailing us is already an indication they're interested. They're looking to you and reaching out, most likely because they're looking to grow their business. But now is not the time to sell. Now's the time to go deeper. So let's cover the questions you can ask them. And to do that, Greamer has volunteered to hop on a call and help us prep. Hey, thanks so much for taking the timer back on. So before we get started, I want to make sure we're on the same page. Sounds great. You know, Greamer, this is really great. I know. You're really into this. Yeah. You don't have to do the voice. If you're feeling pressured, okay. Can you talk about the types of clients you have today? Me, Greamer, or Dmeen. No, Rebecca. You can play Rebecca, but just maybe not so much. Okay. Okay. Go. Mm-hmm. Sure. We really focus on high-end interior design. Most of our clients are remodeling or building a home from scratch. So mainly residential. If you've done few commercial clients, some businesses, but yeah, mainly residential. And how does that compare to the clients you want? Why are you asking her that? What? Why are you asking her that question? Now you're breaking character. Okay. We tend to wrap back again. Why are you asking me Rebecca about the clients I want? Because their current site only talks about residential work. If they're interested in commercial work too. Yeah. So residential now, are you looking to get more commercial clients? We'd love more commercial clients. Great. Thanks, Rebecca. So I want to shift to bigger goals. What are you looking to achieve in terms of growing your business? What's a slam dunk for you? Sports metaphors are the worst. Yeah. I think right now we're learning a lot about what it takes to scale our business. We started back in 1943. I backed that. Greamer's really selling this. Prepping for a call with a friend or colleague is a great way to try this out and prepare. Okay. So one of the things we want to understand is the process. The process your clients go through. Now, Greamer's making the stuff up, but we want to make a list of questions you could ask during your call. What's your goal for the website? What do you like about your current website? What would you want to improve about your website? Can I answer? Sure. Well, I think a lot of people look at our site and think it's a stress. I'm not particularly proud of it. My natural... I'm going to answer to the questions we'll write down during that first scheduled interaction that are going to give us not only a better understanding of their business and their customers, but all the information we need to tailor our approach to make all our recommendations custom to what they're looking to achieve. Am I going to go? Yeah. Thanks, Greamer. And this understanding, reaching deeper than specifications for the kind of site you're going to build, that's what gives you value. You're not just building them a website. You're helping them achieve a goal. And the more you take the time to understand where they're coming from, what the needs of their customers are, how they feel about their business and their business goals, the better experience you can build for them. This extends so far beyond what most people offer. And making sure your potential client gets the sense that you really do care about what they're looking to achieve, that's what separates good freelancers from great freelancers. Just because we have questions for them doesn't mean they don't have questions for us. And this is where you don't just need great questions. You need great answers. So for this part, we'll put ourselves in the client's shoes, right down all the questions this potential client might have. How much is this going to cost? Can you do this work for free? How long will this take? Come up with a list of the toughest questions you might get. These questions might be terrifying at first, but here's the great thing. It's better if we come up with the tough questions before the scheduled client interaction, as opposed to waiting to figure out everything in real time. By doing this, we're able to better practice and prepare. And she might ask us anything. What's your process like? How long does the process take? What if we want to change things later? All these questions can help us better prepare. And we can practice how we'd respond to it. So the call is set. We're well prepared. We have our notes. We're taking more. Let's make the call. What's the number? Four, one, five. One, five. Five, five, five, five. Hi there. Josh is going to transfer us to Rebecca's assistant Eve who will, after putting us in a brief hole to put out a literal fire, eventually connect us to. Hey, it's Rebecca. Thanks for calling. No problem. It's a pleasure to meet you over the phone. How's your day going? Good. We got this brochure you made. And I wanted to figure out how much a website like this would cost. Absolutely. And that's one of the main things we want to figure out on this call. Now, at this point, a lot of people might want to ask how much a client project from her firm costs because that gives us a starting point. Nothing wrong with us saying something like most of our client projects started at $3,000. But instead of going straight to the price, we want to first better understand their needs so that we can make recommendations based on those needs. And the point is a lot of this is based on the scope of what her firm wants to get done. Rebecca. A lot of this is based on the scope of what your firm wants to get done. Okay. Which is why the goal of this call is to make sure we're on the same page regarding what your firm is looking to achieve. That way we can get you a full quote. That's based on what it is we're doing. Got it. So let's start with your current site because there were some questions around this. Okay. So we're looking at your current website. And the first question is, do you find a lot of your clients come from this site? It's mainly word of mouth. We did our site back in. It was 2011. Okay. By the way, details like this are great because I'm taking notes. Cool. So anyway, we get a lot of calls and emails, but usually they're from other clients who refer them to us. Got it. So those calls from the business side, what does that process look like? What do you mean? Well, let's say you get a call from a client wanting to work with you. What happens next? Well, we usually get a client knowing they want something. They're remodeling a kitchen or building a new house. And this is residential clients or do you also do commercial? Just residential. We've done some commercial work in the past, but we're trying to focus exclusively on residential clients. We want to take notes here. So we get an understanding of what they're looking for, whether that's a new home build or renovation. Then we work with them to get a quote. Rebecca, can you talk a little bit more about that? We want to make sure we're on the same page about what happens from the first call to them getting a quote. Well, they usually know what they want. So we'll go out and do a consultation. That's if it's a renovation. Right now, or new build, either way, we'll go out and meet the client to get the measurements. Walk the space. And who does this? Usually one of our junior designers. We're really trying to understand what it's like, what the process is like for their clients. And the reason is, if we understand their process, we can make sure we're offering and later building a site that not only looks great, but is super effective in communicating this process to their clients. Okay, Rebecca. So first they call or email, then you get back to them instead of a consultation. A designer goes out and then what? So when we start, we usually have a budget. So we work with them to price out the project. That's basically the contract phase. We work with them to get a contract together. And then we actually do the work, all the design and development. Okay, great. This is really helpful because the better we understand about your process, the better we can build a site that communicates this to your clients and sets expectations. Sounds great. So number one, there's a consult. Number two, there's a contract. Actually, if it's on a site, we should call it letter of agreement. Okay, good to know. Consultation, letter of agreement, then the design work. Design development. Okay, great. Getting all this down. Then comes everything else. The last step is where we do the construction, the installation, and basically project completion. Okay, so on the existing site, now that we understand a little more about your process, how does your current site do in helping to communicate this process to your clients? I really like that we can get all the contact info from the contact form. And what don't you like about it? The contact form? Well, the website in general, but it can be the form too. Well, on the form, we get a lot of spam. For the whole site, you point out the sound of brochure. It's really tiny on the iPhone. Right. That's really what we're concerned about. Also, we have about a thousand photos of new work, new projects we completed recently. Well, we can definitely work on that. The perfect website. What's a home run for you? We have to stop using sports metaphors. Well, that's why I'm talking to you. Great point. But imagine for a second, you have the perfect site. Forget the design, the contact form. What do you want that website doing for your business? Well, getting us more clients would be nice. So you said word of mouth was pretty big. Do you have an estimate of how many clients you're getting, calls or emails you're getting from the site? I'd say a couple of months, maybe two or three. So the goal of your website, assuming you get a new one built for your design firm, is mainly to get clients. Yes. Got it. Okay. Getting a pretty good understanding. Thank you. My pleasure. Okay. Let's talk about what's next. What I want to do after this call is take what we have here and give you a breakdown. So I want to write out exactly what we're recommending based on what we've covered and exactly how much we're quoting you for that. Okay. So how long is that going to take? Let's aim to have it in your inbox this time tomorrow. Sounds good. Great. Now, what questions do you have for me? For you. Yes. What are the toughest questions you have? Well, how long will it take for you to build a site? That's actually the most common question. So we have a pretty standard answer for it. Usually three to six weeks, but it can really vary based on the scope of work, just like projects with your clients I can imagine. Yeah. How long do you take? A lot more than three to six weeks. We have picky clients. Picky's good. What's the longest a client project has taken? For us. Oh, God. There's one now. More than six weeks? It's been two years. The same client? We've been working on this project for it two years. Rebecca. I want to make you a promise. Now, none of this has to do with the design of their site, the price, the technical details, but clients want to know we understand them. And that's what we're doing here. We're empathizing with someone based on something we have in common. And that's the basis for developing a report. We're understanding each other's feelings and frustrations because we know what it's like to have something take longer than expected. Up until this point, we've gotten a pretty good understanding of the client's business needs. But now we're demonstrating to them we can relate to them personally. That's important because when we connect with a client like this, we're not only showing that we understand the client's business needs, but that we can relate to how they feel. And if we understand that, we can make recommendations and commitments to them based on those feelings. Rebecca. If we decide this is a good fit and we work on this project together, I promise to you now. It will not take two years. I'll need that in writing. We'll get that in writing. Okay. Next, tough question. Okay. What's your process like? For websites? I also think about the full process beforehand. Numbers work well. Rebecca, we work together through four different phases. We're in phase one right now. We start by having a conversation. So we better understand the needs of your business. Then we work on content. This is working with you on written content and getting the assets together like photos of your client work, projects your team has worked on. Okay. Then for phase three, we work on design and development of the actual site. Okay. And finally, we test it and deploy it. This is going to happen, but what if we don't like it? Good question. And the answer is we work together each step of the way. So we'll have regular check-in so we can get any feedback out in the open. And we'll include revisions as part of what you get quoted for the project. What about changes? How can we change the site later? Great question. We'll set up a content management system. A CMS. Right. After we set this up, you can log in. Your team can log in and make changes to text images. You can add client projects to your site. You can do any of this whenever you'd like. Okay. Great. What if we need design changes down the road? Of course. Sometimes there are things that fall outside our original scope of work. And we'll make sure to include an hourly rate up front for additional work that falls outside of our original agreement. That way, if you need something else, you'll know exactly what that rate is. Got it. Okay. What else do you have? So on question and don't take this the wrong way. Never a good start. But my partners will ask. Plus our admin has created some sites before. And I get your job is to sell me on a website. So something like this. Why can't we build this ourselves? Let's slow down. We're on a call. We have about six more seconds until things get awkward. And we can't blame it on a bad connection. The question is this. Why can't they build a site themselves? Before we give an answer, we have to first understand the motivation. Let's dissect. Five seconds left. What's the motivation of the question? Why is she asking? Why is she talking to us if doing it herself is even a consideration? Three possible reasons. Four, if she's just being cruel. We could assume she doesn't understand the complexity involved. That's the case. We can just tell her. Say how complicated it is to build a bespoke website from scratch. But that could backfire. Plus, it sounds like we're saying she can't. Her firm can't do this, which isn't the case. Maybe they want to learn. Four seconds. Possibility number two is that it's about money. What if we're too expensive? She wants all her options. That could be it. But then there's number three. Number three is she wants to know what's different. What value would we add? What can't her firm do themselves? We could go this route. Point to her current site as a reflection of her business. And the clients they're missing out on. How a one-size-fits-all template isn't the best option. But it could be four. She's testing this. She wants to see what our reaction is under pressure. Three seconds left. All these possibilities, a full board. We could ask a follow-up. Pretend we don't understand by us time. We wasted time on voices earlier with Greamer. We had a list of tough questions. Never came up with this. But that doesn't get us anywhere. So let's reverse it. Start in the future. Pretend like we got the client. We already landed the deal. And now we're going to account exactly what we did together. Rule number one of client interactions. Think like the client. If you're thinking about yourself, you've already lost. Rule number two, never played defense. Two seconds. We got the client in the first place because there was some level of trust. And it seemed to her we knew what we were talking about. Each of these four options implies an answer that says, you can't do it. You can't make the website yourself. But that's not how we got the client. Because the answer isn't that they can't do it for themselves. And we can approach this in either of two ways. One second left. We could say, good question. We'll get back to you. Safe. That buys us time. But the other option is this. Jump into the fire. Tell them they can. Then tell them why it should be you. Deep breath. Hello. Yeah. So what's stopping my team from building this? Is this something my firm can do? So it's a really good question. And I can understand why you're asking. And the answer is, you can. I'm sorry. Of course you can. That's the answer. If you want to go through the process in-house, I can respect that. But I'll tell you one thing I know both you and I can relate to. I think there are a lot of your clients who had the same question you just asked me. They asked themselves that same thing when they're budgeting their own projects. Because it's a perfectly valid question. And at the end of the day, I'd argue your clients get way more value out of the quality of work your firm does. And out of the time, they save by not having to become experts in interior design. And the same thing applies here. My job is to have the expertise and do all the heavy lifting in my area. So you and your firm can focus on doing the same for your clients. Good point. And as we're working on this, we're here each step of the way to answer any questions you might have about how what we're working on delivers that value. Great. That's all I can think of, but I'm sure I'll come up with something as soon as I hang up the phone. Well, if you have any questions between today and tomorrow, please feel free to reach out. We'll do. In the meantime, let's get started on that quote. 23 hours and 54 minutes. Sounds great. Thanks so much for your time, Rebecca. It's great talking to you. Great talking with you, Maguire. Have a good one. Bye. You're bye. That's a lot of notes, which is good because we're going to use them. Now you'll notice we didn't cover everything we practiced in the call. That's okay. We covered enough to get a better idea of what the firm is looking to achieve. And we built a dialogue. From here, we list what's included and what will charge, but we'll go further into that in the next part of this course. Now, one more note. This call contained a lot of real-world questions. Real questions. We've gotten from real clients while doing real freelancing, but it's only one way things can go. The best way to get better at this and to grow over time is to practice, get more and more clients, take notes, see what works well, and just as importantly, see what doesn't. But let's recap what we did here. When first contact is made, we take the time to schedule the meeting. Between first contact and the meeting itself, we can come up with questions we want to ask the potential client. Then come up with questions the potential client might ask you. This way, you can walk into the call confident that you have an answer to some of the most difficult questions. But that's all for now. That's preparing for and meeting our potential client.",

    "text": " So, no code and code can play really nicely together. They're actually one thing when you think about it, and it's just how we use them. So, one of the top questions I get whenever I release a site is people ask, well, that site was built with code. Is that really a no code site? You included some code in that, right? And my answer to that is basically, there's no such thing as a site that's built with out code. Every site is built on code. And the beautiful part about no code tools like Webflow is that it allows us to build code in a clean way where we're not having to think about the syntax or how to write it. We don't have to have a missing semicolon that breaks the whole site, but we still have to understand what the code is doing. And in my opinion, that's the hardest part. Is understanding the logic behind why something does what it does, not necessarily how to write it or not write it. Those things can be easily looked up in fact. So, when we use code on top of no code tools, it's really just expanding upon what the no code tools have already taught us. We're able to use that same logic and just add a little bit more functionality onto it that maybe wasn't possible, or maybe it was possible, and there's just a cleaner way to do it by using code. Sometimes using a little bit of code can save so much time. It's the fastest cleanest way to do that. So, why avoid it? It unlocks so much potential and so much power, and we can use no code tools to speed up our workflows. To make things really fast, to where we can really spend all that extra time that we would have had on advanced interactions, functionality, and custom features that improve the user experience across the board. So, no code and code can play really nicely together. They're actually one thing when you think about it, and it's just how we use them. So, you may be thinking, if I already know code, why should I use no code tools? And I hear stories all the time of developers trying Webflow, loving it, and making it their primary platform. So, no code tools really speed up all the initial groundwork that we would have to do. Anything from setting up a database, to setting up a form, these are all very tedious tasks that can be automated. And we rely on no code tools when we do that. It really speeds up the workflow to where we're able to start building even better things on top of it. We're able to worry about the little details that really matter and invest time in those and into the functionality to make a better product. Another thing you may have heard is that using no code tools, sometimes leads to messier, unclean code. And I've tried a lot of no code tools. Simple things like dragging in a div, I inspect the code, and all the sudden, there's all these settings in code that I didn't apply, like Flexbox and margins, and I'm like, why is this one here? It just won't a div with no styles. But when you drag a div into web flow or when you add a block of element, it's completely clean. There's not a single style when there, till you apply it, and it's only the styles that you want there, you can add your own code to on top of it to make things even more efficient, but the base of no code tools like web flow is completely clean and easy to use. So there's so many great resources for learning code. And for me personally, I used an app called MIMO, and it's a free app that you can basically acquisice you on CSS, JavaScript, we were able to understand all the basics. Also develop to free course on YouTube, called the jQuery course, where it goes through all the fundamentals of jQuery. No, jQuery is not dead. Webflow uses it, it's a super clean way to write code, and I highly recommend it if you're a web flow designer to check it out. I've also learned from other jQuery courses on YouTube that were great resources. W3 schools is another great resource for learning CSS. Anything you want to learn, you can go to Google, type it in, and there's going to be the best way or the cleanest way to write it will come up. Honestly though, the knowledge is out there. There's so many great places to learn, it's applying the knowledge that it becomes real to us. So I would just say tackle some things that are maybe a little bit out of your comfort zone. Take on a project in web flow, maybe it's a passion project or something that you're think, I don't know if I'll be able to do this. And once you start and you start looking it up, it's going to challenge you to a point where you're going to begin to learn, and that understanding is going to become real to you. More than any course or any other knowledge out there is when you're actually applying it. And the second thing I would say is find someone that can be your sounding board, that you can bounce ideas off of. I've been very fortunate at the agency I work for to work with a ton of great developers that any time I have a question and I can go to them, share something, and that increases my knowledge so much more. And it advances what would it take me most to learn, I'm able to learn in a couple minutes. And there's nothing like having a great mentor that you can bounce ideas off of that will accelerate your learning so much faster.",

Plain label means no change, amber label means this change is being inherited by a combo class or from another breakpoint. Blue label means a change is made on the current breakpoint. Finally, a pink label means a grid child has specific sizing and layout properties.\n\nOn pink and blue labels, you can clear or reset those styles by clicking on the label itself, or you can hold down Option or Alt and click on the label.\n\nWhen a label in the Style panel is amber, by clicking on it, you can see where that style is being inherited from.\n\n----------\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\nJoin the Webflow Community: https://webflow.com/community\n\nhttps://webflow.com\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

    "text": " Amber, blue, pink. In this micro lesson, which you know is micro because I'm scaled down considerably inside this video, we'll talk about all three of these, including what they mean and how to clear them. So for all my CSS properties in the style panel, I can basically control everything. And when I'm just getting started, I can see plain labels, but I can also see some of them are amber without me doing anything. Amber means it's inheriting a value here, and I can just click the label and see where it's coming from. But the moment I change it, boom, it's blue. Blue means I made a change to this style property on this breakpoint. So if I go to tablet, I can see the same property is now amber. And we know why, it's because it's now inheriting that style from the change I just made on desktop. And if I change the value again here on tablet, now it's blue here too. Remove it by going in and resetting, now it's back to amber. And we can see it's inheriting from desktop again. By the way, you can always hold down option or alt on your keyboard and click a label to reset the property instead of clicking in. So plain means it's not a changed value. Amber means it's inheriting a style from somewhere else. And blue means I've actively changed the style on the current breakpoint. What about pink? Well, CSS Grid is special. And there are times where I'm using a bunch of items that have the same class. But what if I want one of those items to span multiple grid cells? Well, when I make that change, boom, pink label. Pink means it's affecting the currently selected grid shell, something that's a child of a grid. But not the whole class, meaning I can change these things one by one. So plain label means the property's not really set. Amber means it's inheriting a value from somewhere else. Blue means I made a change to styling on this breakpoint. And pink means it's just affecting the currently selected element, not the class itself. So not the shortest lesson on reference university, but perhaps the smallest.",

The first is to hand-code it, and frankly, I don't know what's more impressive, the fact that I memorized that file name, or that I typed it that fast with my left pinky and right elbow. Two is in Webflow. Go to Assets, press the button that looks like Upload, select something, or multiple some things, and open. Three is by dragging and dropping from a folder or from my desktop, and boom, a lots of WebPs. Four, CMS, same way, click and drag. I could also use a CSV, but frankly, I don't want to break my rhythm. And five, oh, number five. Fabulous. And the extra way, how can I convert to WebP? In my assets, I can go in and expand the panel. This is what I call Super Mode, and I just select whatever images I want to convert, and then I just, honestly, well, I just press this Compress button. What's happening behind the scenes? If WebP conversion will yield a smaller file size, conversion takes place. If not, it won't convert. The big benefit here is I just reduce my total asset size by like 300,000%, which is not true. It's 3,000%, except it's not that either. And just as a note, all instances of this asset throughout my site have been updated with a compressed version. Now, we have tons of info about why and when we should use WebP over on Webflow University. So check out our article if you haven't done that already.

And that's a problem. Imagine if only one out of every 400 people knew how to write. Think how many world-changing ideas would have never seen the light of day. We'd be stuck in the dark ages. And when it comes to software development, we kind of are. So what if, instead of writing hundreds of lines of code to add new features to your website, you could just design them directly on your website? What if you could create the next world-changing product without writing a single line of code? That's the future for creators, and it's about to change everything. It's time to unleash the power of software development to everyone by making it visual. So anyone can harness the power of code to build a website, nap, or an entire business without actually writing it. At Webflow, we're doing exactly that. We're empowering creators to design, build, and launch amazing things. No code required. Welcome to the future of software development. Welcome to the age of no code.",

And all those rectangles, those boxes, they're just stacking on top of each other or sitting next to each other based on properties we set. That is it. The web is built upon boxes of content. And there are three fundamentals, three important things we need to know about the box model. The first one, we just covered. Everything can be expressed in boxes. That's one part down. The second thing is that by default, those boxes behave like a text document. Things start at the top left, and they can even wrap when they hit the edge. Now, why is the web this way? There's a reason. If you think of something in a fixed kind of static size like a slideshow, it might look great on a laptop. But down on a phone, not so great. But unlike this, content on the web can reflow. And the box model lets us clearly define how these things respond, how they wrap, how they reflow based on the space available. This is why the web, all of it, is built on the box model. Part two, things on the web, those boxes respond just like a text document. And the third thing is this. All this content, all these boxes, you can control them. They're sized, all these boxes are sized based on the content inside. But we can always set our own dimensions and add our own spacing. For dimensions, that's adding properties for width, and that's adding properties for height. For spacing on any box, we can add space inside the box. We can add padding, and we can add margin, which is space outside the box. The space between boxes. So, what's the point with this third bullet or third section here? Boxes of content are in no way fixed. You have full control over all of it. Now, we showed some of the basic things that make up the size and the spacing of these boxes, but that's only the beginning. Because once you realize all this stuff on the web is just boxes, and once you realize you can control it based on properties you can set, you can change, or you can build almost anything. So, let's quickly recap. The elements of the web are expressed in boxes. They flow on the page just like a text document, and we can add properties to these boxes to build out some of the most impactful designs and layouts out there. This is just the beginning. So, let's dig deeper into the content that makes up these boxes. We'll do that in intro to HTML. If you're watching this on Beffler University, thank you so much. We really, really appreciate it. But if you're watching on YouTube, thank you for watching there too, and thank you for subscribing. And, actually, when you subscribe, my confidence goes out of this roof. You know, the Twitter following, just, just, run, run, rise, it's up. So good. So, keep subscribing, keep watching, and we really, really appreciate it.",

    "text": " Background videos are a great way to engage website visitors. The problem is, sometimes they can cause motion sickness or cypress sickness. A lot of this can cause distraction and even harm. Not to mention, anything that auto place requires a way to pause or hide or just stop something like this in order to be level A we can't complain. So I want to demonstrate this with a background video element. When I drag it in, there's two things to note. It's pretty boring as is, that's because I need to actually choose a background video. Once that's done, we'll give it a height of 100 v8. So it takes up the full height of the viewport. And then we'll drag in some content. I'm cheating and I already have a container with everything inside. But the second thing is really powerful. It comes by default with a play pause button. I can always talk of this over in element settings, but it works like this. If we look in the navigator, we can see that inside the background video, there's a little button here. And it has two states. This is kind of like the success and error states in a form. We can replace our images. We can change whatever. Here's an example where we replace with a custom SVG and even add it a backdrop filter and a border. All of this we can customize. And to access each of these states, we can toggle them from that same place over in element settings. And here's how it works. On the site, the background video auto place. But if I press the pause button, boom, video paused. Resume, it resumes. Now, if someone has reduced motion turned on on macOS or show animations in Windows toggled off, the background video won't play by default. And it'll just pause itself as it loads. This will also happen on a lot of mobile devices when limiting data. Keep in mind, if you do want to replace the image asset, make sure you click on the link. Make sure your alt text is still set. So it's navigable by folks using a screen reader. And unless there's a really good reason not to, making sure all background readers have a play pause button is a great way to provide users with critical control over how they interact with your site. So we strongly recommend always featuring a button like this. But that's the play pause button in a background video with me as the background video in the web flow designer.",

Here's a collection of recipes, and here's a collection of authors of blog posts with only one author, me, Glimmer. For any number of different reasons, you may at some point find yourself doing this. Or trying to do this. As you may notice, I cannot delete this collection. Why? There are three things to note here. First off, if we're deleting a collection, we have to make sure to first delete the items inside that collection. And I can just select all of these and delete. Is my collection deleteable now? Maybe, because there are two other common things that make it so I cannot delete my collection. Because the second thing we have to do is to see what connections we have to this collection. So here's what that means. Even if we no longer have collection items, there are still things in our project that can be connected to this collection. So, this is a hidden magic button. When reviewing these connections, we can actually disconnect each of these one by one. I'm just clicking on the button and disconnecting. And then, after we delete it all our connections, can we finally delete the collection? Possibly. But I made this project a ducy on purpose. So I can demonstrate one more print case. What if there's another collection that has a field with references this collection? Well, I can go into the other collection that references this and make sure to remove that reference. That way, this second collection is no longer tied to it. It's the little things like this where structured data is referencing other structured data. It's these little things that make me happy to finally after all this hard work and, frankly, incredible work. If I do say so myself, where I can finally delete the collection. And when I do, oh, look, I'm not even at the desk anymore. But when I do, it finally deletes. So let's review. To delete a collection, delete collection items inside the collection. Then we unlink any connections under view connections. And finally, we make sure to remove any references to the collection in another collection. Then, and only then, can we successfully delete the collection? That's deleting a collection in the Vavlo CMS.",

    "text": " I was browsing apple.com the other day, trying to find out how to watch TV. But apparently pressing watts takes you somewhere else. It was then and only then that I saw that Banner in its full beauty. Not only can I get 3% daily cash back with Apple Carrot, oh no, I can pay for my new Apple Watts over 24 months interest free. But the big thing that stood out to me is this Banner. Like other banners, it was clean, elegant and the animation was really smooth. So I want to talk through rebuilding a Banner like this in the Webflow designer. And the concepts we're using here are exactly the same if you're building this with custom code or you're using a visual development platform like Webflow. So we'll break it down into three things. Structure, basically the anatomy and styling of the Banner. Then the interaction and animation itself. And finally we'll figure out how I can watch TV on apple.com. Structure, we'll have our text and it'll be nestled inside our text wrapper. And then all of that is placed inside a banner, which is nestled inside of a banner wrapper. Two questions. First, why this layout? And second, isn't it nested and not nestled? The magic comes from the fact that the text is constrained by the text wrapper. It keeps things narrow. And the banner itself is what houses all of this. But the banner wrapper is what serves as the secret window and it clips off the banner as it animates in. So let's set it up. We'll build this structure in reverse order. We'll start with the parent-most element. Let's add a div. We'll place this anywhere on the page. But I'll put it under the nav bar. And let's create a class to keep this organized. I'll call it Banner wrapper. And that's the start. Inside the banner wrapper, of course, we'll add another div. Why? Because this one and we'll add a class again, this one is our banner. So let's set the background color here. Open mind, we're not adding any dimensions yet and the reason we're not doing that is because a lot of this is going to be sized by the text itself. OK, inside the banner is our text wrapper. Oh, look, another div. This one is the text wrapper. So we're almost there. We'll just make sure to add a class with that name here. This one's different. Because like we said a moment ago, we'll use it to keep things neatly contained towards the center. So let's set a maximum with Apple does 980, you can do whatever you want. And let's set the mouse in on both sides to auto. This will keep things centered. OK, and finally, let's add our text. Now Apple uses a paragraph here. That's probably our best bet. But you can really add anything, an image, a link, a button. And we can style the paragraph however we want here to get it looking just the way we wanted to. Now one more thing before we move into interactions, this looks OK. But paragraphs by default can come with some bottom margin. So we'll go in and zero that out. And also the text is pretty tight on the sides. Let's select our text wrapper and add some padding to create some breathing room on all four sides. Just holding them shift to adjust all four sides at once. Also since we'll be creating an animation here, we want to make sure that the banner is hidden. on Apple, notice how the banner is not visible outside of this boundary before it animates in. So to make sure we have the same on our design with the banner wrapper selected, let's go over and make the overflow hidden. This will click content outside the boundary. And that my friends is it. Can we take it even further? Sure, I'll just paste new text with slightly more competitive terms than Apple's. OK, interactions. This one's pretty simple. We have an initial state in which the banner is sort of tucked out of you. And we have a fully loaded state. So that after the page loads up, we can slide down the banner into view. So let's build it out. Let's make sure our banner is selected, not the wrapper. And let's go in and add an interaction. We want this to be a page trigger. So when the page loads, we want some kind of animation to happen. And here's where we can define that. We can have it start on animation. And this can be a new animation we build ourselves. We'll call it new animation we'll build ourselves. Except no, we won't. That's a terrible name. Let's rename it to banner slide in. OK, so to recap, two points, starting point, ending point. Let's click in to add a starting point. And we'll be moving this. So let's choose move. And just to demo, we're moving this up and down the y-axis. But what we really want to do is to make sure it goes 100%. This is the full height of the banner. We want to make sure it's 100% up. So we can't see it through the banner wrapper. So we'll set this to negative 100%. And now where did it go? It's sitting right out of view. And to make sure this is what it does by default. In fact, if I press the play button when the page loads, it's actually doing the opposite of what we want. But to make sure this is the initial state, so it's tucked up on page load, we'll set this action as the initial state. OK, that's the first part, the starting point. Second, we'll add one more action. This one's also a move action. And at this point, we want to zero it out. In other words, we want it back at the origin. What will that do? Let's see, play button. And we can see, it goes from its starting point, its initial state to the origin, where we want it to be. Now, we can do some other things here. For instance, we can go in and change the easing. We can control the type of easing curve that dictates the rate at which the y-position will do whatever. And let's add a 0.2 second delay here before our animation starts. And the other thing we can do, if we really wanted to be like Apple, is we can change our colors after loads. So let's add two more points there. First, let's change our background color. So we'll add another action after it animates in. And that action will change the background color. Well, change the color to black. We can select any color here. And we actually don't want this to happen instantly. So let's go in and make sure this action starts in two seconds. We can just add that delay here. And we can change the text color to. For this, let's select the paragraph. And once we do, we'll sort of click in specifically to make sure we're adding a concurrent action. And you'll notice how it's sort of groups. Let's select text color. And when we do, it groups it. So this animation will happen at the same time as the background color. And we'll change this color to either light gray or maybe white. And if we go into preview mode, what happens? OK, I didn't press the button. But when I do, boom, animates in. Colors change, magic. So there's a lot we can do with something like this. Let's recap what we did to get here before we get to step three. We added four elements, a banner wrapper, a banner inside of that, a text wrapper, and some text inside of that. We did a bunch of stuff to it using a secret language called CSS. And that letters get the layered position exactly how we wanted it. Then we went and added an interaction. On page load, we're following a custom animation. And the animation follows our actions. Move in from the initial position to the origin. And then change the colors of the background and the other thing that's the opposite of the word background. Finally, for step three, I'm going to try and figure out how to what's Apple TV Plus, particularly Ted Lasso on Apple's website. Yeah, pull TV. How does this work? How is it apple.com? Do it. OK, no, I found Apple TV Plus. There we go. OK, stream now. OK, open TV. Welcome to TV. Start watching. All right, Ted Lasso, I'm coming for you. Wait. OK. Start free trial. Apple IT. OK. Password. I mean, how do you take your tea? It's going to be good. Well, usually I'll take it right back to the counter if someone's made a horrible mistake.",

    "description": "Use components to reuse any elements in your project and speed up your design process. Almost anything can be made into a component. A change to one instance of a component will affect all instances of that component. You can set properties on a component so you have control over individual instances. And you can unlink individual instances of a component so that changes to it won't affect the others.\n\n00:00 \u2014 Intro\n00:38 \u2014 Create\n00:50 \u2013 Reuse\n01:19 \u2013 Edit\n02:00 \u2013 Properties\n04:14 \u2013 Unlink\n\nTo learn more visit Webflow University \u2192 https://university.webflow.com/lesson/components\n----------\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\nJoin the Webflow Community: https://webflow.com/community\n\nhttps://webflow.com\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

    "text": " With components, you can design ones and reuse the thing you designed throughout your site. But there's so much more power than this. Components are great for a lot of things. Navbars, check, footers, check, cards, check, buttons, tiny check mark, inside the button. We'll cover creating components, reusing them, editing components, setting properties on them, and finally, un-linking them completely. Now, components are basically magic, and since magic is science and science is real, the transitive property applies. Components are real. Part one, creating components. Here's a nav bar on a page. Select the nav bar, look over here, create component. I'm going to name it navigation. That's creating a component. What about reusing it? Let's escape out of the component, and now that I've created a component out of my nav bar, let's go to another page. We have no navigation here. So let's go to components. We can now drag the nav bar, the navigation component, right into our page, right at the top. So what just happened? These are now two instances of the same component. Even though they're on two different pages, they're just representations of a single component that lives in the ether. Let me prove it. Part three, editing a component. With my components selected, let's go up to edit component. Let's set the text result. If I make a change to the content, if I switch the order of features and meditation, it applies to every instance. I know, greener, greener, we don't believe you. But here's the proof. If I go back to the other page, the change I just made has been made there too. Change something else? It affects all instances of that component. So we can create a component out of anything. We can re-use it anywhere, and when we make a change on one instance, it affects all instances. However, sometimes I want things to be a bit more specific. Part four, component properties. Maybe I want the nav bar on 10 different pages. And maybe the nav bar has a button. But what if there's a page on my site where I want this navigation, but I don't want this button. Here's a page where we will do exactly that. Download PocketSend. I want my navigation, but on this page only, I don't want the button, because it would basically take me to the page I'm on. So what I need to do is control the visibility of this button on just this page. How do I do it? Let me just select the button. I'm not editing the component or anything, just selecting the button, and I'll go to Element Settings. And check it out. I can add a property to control visibility. What happens? Nothing. And that's the lesson. Thank you. Now, if you want something to happen, Lauren, can you cut back to me? No, that's camera B. Back to me. But now that I created that property, I can control visibility. So on this page, if I want to hide the button, I just hide the button. I set the property and the button is gone. But check this out. If I go over back to the other page, it's still there. That's because properties let me control what happens on any one instance of a component. But it doesn't have to affect all instances. Here's another example. But instead of visibility, let's show how we do this with text. On cart, let's make it a component. This time, I'll just right click, make it a component. I'll affectionately call it whatever I want. And when I do, let's escape out of the component. And because it's a component, I can add another one. Same component right next to it. But I don't want the second one saying the same thing. Double click on the text. Let's change the text in the second one. Nope. It's wrong. I'm fixing that. Okay. So what just happened? We just created a property on the text. In fact, over in element settings, we can see this. And we just changed the text. But it's still a component. So if I edit it, any instance, to move some stuff around, make changes or add stuff, both of them are even and matched. And let's escape out of the component. That's creating component properties. Finally, let's talk on linking. At any time, if I no longer want this one linked to any others, I can unlink. I'll just right click on this instance and unlink it. What just happened? The component still exists. And we can use it wherever. But the unlinked version here is on its own. So I can add stuff, change stuff, whatever. And it doesn't affect any other instances. It's no longer a component. So let's recap. You can turn anything, including all its children into a component. You can then reuse that component anywhere. And from any instance, you can edit the component, which will affect all instances. But you can also create properties directly on an instance. You can change text, link stuff, visibility, whatever. And if you like, you can unlink any instance from the component. I'm Greamer. That's components in Webflow. And my audio has been very clearly matched within post.",

    "text": " In this lesson, we're going to build a form. And for this example, it will be a lead generation form. We want to capture leads for our fictional business and it'll look like this at the end. And we'll move fairly quickly in five steps. First, we'll go over what's in a form, the anatomy. We'll show how to configure form elements, we'll style our form, we'll talk success and error states, and finally, we'll control what happens when someone fills out this form. Let's take a look at the anatomy. So we can bring in a form. By the way, there are lots of form things you can add, but we'll start with our form block from the ad panel. We can just drag that in. And by default, the form block has a bunch of stuff inside already. And this is critical for one reason. We need a form block to actually capture the form data. And while there's a lot of stuff we can see, it's only a third of what's inside. Open up the form block. There's actually three things. The form itself, what we see, but second, we have a success message when someone submits the form. And finally, an error message, if someone has a problem submitting. And if we take a tiny looksy under form, we have pretty much everything we see on the caps, all the labels, text fields and the submit. You literally think, well, what's up? We're filming. You can't say that. I can, Miguel, and I just did. Otherwise, form anatomy is boring. But one really good practice here, do not delete the field labels. These are often critical for accessible navigation. So if you're tempted to go minimal, consider other ways of doing that. And if we wanted to add other form elements, like the ones we see here, we can track those right in. Let's do that now. We can start to build this sort of lead generation form. So we'll add in the fields we want. But dragging and dropping stuff is boring. Yeah. So with a magic of editing, now we have everything we need for our leads and form. email, phone number, company size, and a text area to add in more information. Let's talk configuration. What is our goal? We're adding these different elements so that we can gather all the information we need from potential customers who are filling out this form. So with a lot of these form elements, we can sort of double click on them or even just click the little button. And we can see all our options. Let's say we really need to get their name and email. Well, we can go in and make sure not only the name, but also the email are marked as required. Maybe the others are optional. It's up to you. I like to make everything required, but let's be honest. It's also the reason Miguel is still filling out my birthday RCP, even though I haven't did celebrate my birthday over. Yes. About three weeks ago. But there's more going on in these configuration options. Anytime we see the name field in our input settings, this is how we'll identify the field internally, which will show up on form submissions. Users won't see this name directly, but it still shows up in the code. So be careful not to include something you wouldn't want users to see. Up next, the type of text like email. This is essentially validation. For email, that will check to make sure what's written in the field is an email. Not a random smashing of keyboard characters like Miguel's default typing mode. That's not my default typing mode. Sorry, Miguel. That's okay. After that, we have playsoldor, which is the text that displays before someone types something in the field. This gets overwritten the moment you start typing in the field. Then the required option. We covered this earlier and it stops someone from submitting the form without filling this out. And the other big one is autofocus. When a user loads up this page, this text field will already have focus. It'll have a blinking cursor. Be careful though. If your forms on a long page, it could lead to someone getting automatically pushed down to the bottom of the page. We also have options for our submit button. Double click that and here we can change the text to something thrilling, like in gates or submit or execute. Also, if we want, we can change the waiting text. This is the text that will replace the button text temporarily while the form is being submitted. Is that everything? No. Because each form element has different options. There is input settings based on each element type which you can access in the element settings. In fact, there are secret options in different elements that hopefully you will discover while building your own forms. But let's move on to styling. This is super powerful. Field labels, we know this. Field labels are here by default. I have a textile called label in my project which already has some typography styles. And I can quickly apply that same class by selecting each label and adding that class right in. I'm using the command enter keyboard shortcut which lets me jump right to this electrophilte. Also, my keyboard and mouse are doing all of this for me. Let's also go ahead and create a class for our text fields. We'll call this class fields because we're using it for other stuff. Background color. Let's make this lighter gray color. We have a swats for that. Border, let's change the color on the border to 0% on the alpha. By the way, why? I'm going to cover why in just a moment. And that's it for now. Let's make sure we apply that class to all of our text fields. But we'll actually go ahead and take that one step further. Because we'll also apply those style changes to our select field, the sort of company size thing. And we'll do the same thing for our text area. We'll select it and make sure that same class is applied. Real quick, let's cover placeholders because that's a request we get a lot. Placeholder text is actually a state. Yeah, I checked. It's not. Riveting. Miguel. Let me show you what I mean. With any of these fields selected, let's make sure the field is selected and it has a class applied. But we can go into our drop down and check this out. Placeholder. Placeholder refers to the text that's pre-written. We've still this before. So if we want to really, really light gray because minimalism, we can do that. Of course, it's about the least visible thing in the world. And frankly, it's searing my retinas just trying to read this text. So let's make it gray and not so horrible. But that's placeholder. What if we want to change the color of the typed text? So when someone starts typing into any of these text fields, we're controlling that color. Let's just make sure we're styling none. And we'll go down and affect the font color. Let's make it something obvious like red. And when we do, we can head over to preview and start typing something in. And it's red. Notice how that also affected this elect field for the company size. Okay, back at our preview mode, go back over and open up the font color, make it slightly less red than the red it is now, hydrate. Because hydration is critical. Now the text is not red, but there's another important part about typing stuff in. And that's letting users know when a particular field is selected or focused. So if we go to preview our page and click inside a text field, that field is now focused. Depending on how you style your project, you might like it as is, or maybe you're looking to do something different. If that's the case, we can override that style. And we can access the focus by selecting the text field and clicking on states. And we can see we have focused. And from here, we can style the state. For us, we could do something like changing the background color, drawing some more attention to it by making it a bit darker and more obvious. Before the focus date, a really common thing is a border. That set our color to a black border so we see the effect. If we go into preview mode after this, we can click through and see what that focus date looks like. But remember, earlier we made the border color transparent. Why? Why didn't we just set the border to zero pixels? Here's exactly why. If we took our text field in the non-state, not in focus just in none, and we set it to zero pixels, the border disappears. That's expected. And if we went into the focus date and set it to something like five pixels, I'm just adding this to prove a point here. Here's the problem. If we go back to our non-state, we can just hit escape on the keyboard and we go into preview mode. Notice how it affects the document flow. Things jiggle around and other things are focused. So one of the better ways to do this is the following. On the non-state, like we showed before, let's make sure we set the border to one pixel. I'm not setting anything to zero pixels this time, but I am setting the color of that border. It's alpha to zero. That way we don't see the border. And on the focus date now, we can go back in and set that alpha to anything else. Give it some more contrast. And now, if we go back to the non-state and go to preview, we're all set. We can see the border as we select, as we focus on each text field. All that work, and for this design, I'm actually going to remove that darker color, since we can still see the focus effect with the background color. Anyway, once I get the design ready for proofing, I can go into preview and see what it looks like when each field, each text field is focused. Now there are magical advancements in CSS like CSS Outlines that make a lot of this even easier. We have tons of that on reference university, but for now, let's move on to style or button. With our buttons selected, we can style it. We can style the weight, the size, and the color of our font, the letter spacing. We can even go in and change the capitalization. And let's change the background color too. These have just changed this we're making, but you can style it however you like. Let's move on to success and error states. What we see on the canvas right now is the normal state. In fact, with our form blocks selected, we can head over to the element settings and we can see it's on normal. So it's over to success. Now we see what happens when someone submits the form. We have some placeholder text, and as long as we've selected the success message block in the navigator, we can style the block or anything inside. And you can literally add additional things, as an example, and dragging in an image. And it's the same thing with the error state. If there's a problem submitting the form, same type of control here that we had for a success message. Back to normal state, and we have full access to our normal form. Finally, let's bring this all together into receiving these form submissions. And there are only two things to note. The first one is simple. If you have one form, multiple forms, whatever, you can go to the form settings and set the name of the form. But for part two, let's talk about what actually happens when someone sends a form. Of course, that form data is captured and will show up under project settings. And once we're there, we can go over to where it says forms. And all our form data is all the way down at the bottom. But if I scroll up on these page, I can control the other aspect of this. Who gets notified when a form is submitted? Simply enough, if I want the form data to always get sent to me, greenmanatstudio, brook.com. Now I'll get an email. Want to add Tiresha? Tiresha addstudio.com. And now a copy of the form gets sent to me and Tiresha every time it's filled out. However, from name, what even is that? Is it a typo? Is it supposed to say form name? No. From name is who or what that notification email is sent from. I can also control the subject line or the reply to line. If I want the email to be replied to, I will. And I can control the body of the email. For a lot of these, I can also use variables. And we have tons of information on that on Webflow University. So check that out if you haven't already. Again, when someone submits the form, that submission data will be emailed to the address or addresses. And it'll also be listed below. You can access it right here or you can even download a CSV file. But that, my friends, and Miguel, is forms. We went over the basic anatomy of our form. We double-click to configure and change the input settings on our elements. We styled our form. We talked states, including success in error messages. And finally, we covered form submissions. What happens when a user submits that form? When we're all done, we can publish our site in just a couple clicks. And go test this out in the production environment. One, two, three, type, type. I just wrote Act 3, seen one of Hamlet. But I also covered the basics of forms with all of you in the Webflow designer.",

You can also override content in all instances of a component, so changes in that component won\u2019t affect the others.\nNow, you can nest components within other components \u2014 just like \u201cInception\u201d (2010).

    "text": " Why would anyone ask that component inside another component? Component-based design is taking over the web because it allows us to design and develop something once and keep the structure consistent across multiple instances of that component. And where it gets really powerful is when you start thinking in systems of components, where you want the same structure but you want to swap out text or specific links or images. In this lesson, we're going to teach the concept of nesting a super common component, a button, inside a bunch of other components, like a navbar or a cart, who also talk about why we're using components as opposed to relying on styling and classes. And then we'll quickly cover properties that can control text, links, visibility, and a special section I'm calling the Dark Knight. You know what? That's the wrong Christopher Nolan film. The section is called Inception. Let's start with nesting. Here's a link block. We're using a link block instead of a button because we need multiple things inside, text and on image. What is our goal? Our goal is to nest this button in the navbar up here and in the cart down here. So before we do, let's make it a component. Right click and we'll go down and create a component. I'm going to name this button. Let's hit escape a few times to exit and now that it's a component, I can go up and edit my navigation component. And I can go in and drag the button component right into my navigation. That's it. We nested a component within a component. Let's not stop here. Let's do it again. Let's escape out and go down to these two carts. There they are, found them. And I can edit either of them. I can go in and edit the component. I can go to my components, find the one we made. And of course, I can drag the new component right inside. Once we do, it's in both. That's it for part one, nesting components in other components, part two, why. Let's escape out and show exactly why we did this. Now that I've implemented this button and it's basically, you know, everywhere, I'm going to make a change. This is different from using CSS from using classes or other selectors to keep styles consistent. And that's because components, let me keep structure and content consistent. So to prove that point, I'm actually going to change content. Let's click the button and go up to edit component. And since I want to edit the button component, let's edit the button component. And check this out. I'm going to replace the image. Let's go down, replace a image, and I'm going to scroll down and see if I can find an image better suited to the button. And when I do, first let's escape a few times and hope that's my desktop. But yeah, we can go back and see it updated on all instances of this nested component in the cards, up in the nap bar, and even where it wasn't nested, just in this section. In fact, let me go in, edit the component here. And once I'm editing the button component, let me change the text. By later, let's make that by now. And frankly, we don't need to yell it, so we'll remove the propone maki escape out. Same thing here, change is to content and structure are kept consistent. And that is the power of components, change the component once, and the content and the structure change on all instances of that component. So let's build on that part three, what if I don't want to change the text on everything. Instead, I want to change only one instance at any time and notice how I'm not going in and editing a component, I can just double click text directly, even if that text is in side a component. And I can just change it. So this one can say, learn more. I can go down, double click the text here, and this time change the text to say, I don't know, roll, name, and roll. And that's it. What's the difference here? Why did we change content in part two and part three? And how are these text changes any different? Answer, because I'm not affecting all of them. And here's why, if I'm not editing the component, if I don't go in and edit the button component or the navigation component or whatever, change is directly on the text, they only affect that instance, the one anti-ractly changing. But when I do go in and edit the component, like we did in part two, I can actually see the default text, the text that serves as the starting point. As I escape out, I can see whatever changes I made to that instance. But let's undo and keep it as and roll. So that's part three. Same thing with links. Select this button component. I'll just head over to element settings, where I can add a property for link. And because I want this button component to link out somewhere else, as you might guess, I can have it linked wherever I want this button to link. And maybe I want this button going to another page. I can change whatever I want here. And the link I'm applying, linking to this other page, will only affect this instance of the button component. So if I want to check that this is true, I can see this one takes me to the URL and this one takes me to the other page. That's links. For part five, let's do visibility. Same concept. If I want to set visibility of the little image in this button, I just select the little image and I can add a visibility property. Let's hide just this image. And like we expect, it only affected this one. So same deal as text properties, link properties. I'm selecting the thing I want to change directly and adding properties that change that thing. That's image visibility. So what is inception all about? Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. Yes, I must admit, I'm reading that from Wikipedia. Inception with components occurs when you try and think through something like this. What happens if I want to hide that same arrow, but in my navigation, we know how to do this. And when I do set that to hidden, what happens? Well, obviously it's hidden. My expectation might be that it hides that little image on all my navigation components. But does it really? If I go to another page, if I switch to another page that has the navigation, the arrow is still there. So here's what we desperately need, which is also what the 2010 Christopher Nolan film inception needs to even begin to make sense. A diagram. Whenever I set a component property anywhere on my site, in other words, if I'm not editing a component, but just selecting something inside one, it affects just that instance. On level deeper, if I go in and edit my navigation component, if I'm editing that component, then I select something inside there, that change affects all instances of the component I'm editing. That's how we get the little image to disappear in all my navigation components. And one last level deeper, what if I'm editing the button component itself, the component inside the component? Editing the button component means all instances of the button component will have that change applied. So is it as confusing as inception? No, inception had four levels of reality or five depending on the diagram, but is it as powerful as inception? You bet it is. Let's recap, because what we just did was impressive. We nested a component within a component twice, and we showed why using nested components is so impactful by changing the main component to update all instances. We then edit instances of the button component by changing the text and adding links. We set visibility properties on a little image to hide the image, and finally, we reach inception level components to understand how to unlock their full potential. There's a ton to explore and a ton to learn, but that's an overview of nesting components within components within workflow.",

    "text": " I'm a designer from Pinnacle Assurance in Denver, Colorado. I'd like to see if you can, what would you attribute the Webflow University to the rise of your success and the amount of investment you've been in addition to having one of the most approachable tech tools in the market today. Your university is just brilliant, really engaging and full of really useful informative tools that brings people to your style, the method, the delivery. It's all brilliant. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about the investment in it and maybe is there a future for where it's going? I can take a while before you answer it. Can we actually get a round of applause for Webflow University and all the people who are welcome? Thank you. I mean the short answer I could just say Stacy. I actually think Webflow University has been a really interesting learning experience for us. For not only learning the right ways to teach something, because if you look at Webflow, I think if you look at the learning curve for something like a simple drag and drop web builder, it's like you drag your elements in and we realize when you try to put a button in the center of the screen and you don't know the principles of HTML, CSS, and you do that and it just goes, it chunks. It goes to the top left. You're like one of two things. One, this software sucks. It doesn't work. Two, I don't know enough to be successful and I'm frustrated and I'm going to go ahead and leave. So very early on we knew we needed to create some type of teaching to get people onboarded in a way that's like here's the principles of HTML and CSS. I think it could be successful. Then came the how. And I think the how actually started with Vlad and Sergi and Brian long before I got involved before I was a Webflow user before I agency's Webflow. And I think for us we just get bored pretty easily. We watch a lot of tutorials. We read a lot of documentation out there and very often it's long. Very often it doesn't get to the point. So I think what we look at for our documentation team, what we look at for our video team is how can we get to the point quickly and how can we make it interesting for people? The weird part is how we do it behind the scenes. And so if you put a camera on a camera on a camera or you talk to our documentation team so much of it occurs from us just trying to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who's going to get frustrated with this feature if they don't know how to use it. And then we work backwards from there. I think the other big key to this though is that there's this marriage between understanding that it's not just education. It's also community. So we look at education and community at Webflow as people are signing up for this tool. What can we do to make sure on day one moment one they have everything they need to be successful? And how can we show up to support them? How can they feel connected to others who might be going through the same thing? Or who might have been through that? They've been there. They've done that. How can we connect them with other communities, sub communities so they have the resources they need to be successful? In terms of investment, God, we really strongly believe in education and community at Webflow. We think community is the lifeblood. I don't know. And if you want to add to that, there's a lot there and a lot coming. Yeah, I think like honestly as a user as well, I think like many folks in this room have been deeply impacted by that kind of lonely moment when you're like, oh crap, this is really, I've said crap three times with us now. This is hard. It's hard to learn and to feel like you don't know what you're doing. And for a lot of people, I think that is a huge reason why Webflow University is so impactful. And why it's such a no-brainer when we think about investment is because it makes you feel like you're not alone. And it's very much so the first step. For so many people into feeling like they know people like McGuire and his humor already off the bat to being able to reach out and ask for help in our community. And I think when we think about education and community and really like when we think about investment there, it's really a lot of it's time. And it's time that doesn't feel like work because it's all focused on how we can make things easier. And the beautiful thing about that is that through community and through all the incredible comments and even questions like this, it reminds us why we're constantly working on that and those comments help us better understand where we can move next. So in the future, really continuing to lean on the community of what's that next step, what's the other places that we can start to invest in and maybe even co-create as we continue to think about our marketplace strategy and how we can be on our existing user base. Yeah, and I know you asked the question about what's coming next. There's some stuff we can't talk about. Stay tuned. So some exciting stuff. Thank you. Thank you.",

    "text": " We're going to take a site design from Figma and turn it into a full-blown production build in Webflow. There was no editing magic there where we stitched together different video clips, except in the way that we stitched together different video clips to demonstrate copying a design from Figma and pasting it into Webflow. This works really well if you're used to designing in Figma and you want a quick way to turn those designs into production code with the click of a button. And technically another click where you go over to Webflow and a keystroke to paste it in. There are some critical things though to cover here. First, we'll show how to install the plugin. We'll put together our design in Figma using two methods. First, with a pre-built structure, which is essentially structural wireframes. And next, with pre-built layouts, which have elements already added. And finally, we'll transfer the design to Webflow. So, first part, install the plugin. This is not the plugin, but we are in Google Chrome. Let's switch tabs. We're doing this from Chrome to show the full page, the full Figma to Webflow plugin page. We've included a link with this video. And let's go and try it out. What happens? It opens a new Figma design file so that we can run the plugin. And of course, we can authenticate it with our entire workspace, our entire Webflow workspace or any specific Webflow sites that we want to use. Now, you can do this in the Figma app. You can do this in your browser. It's entirely up to you. And back in Figma, if you don't see the plugin right away, you can just go up to resources. You can open the plugins to have and, of course, run the Figma to Webflow plugin. That's part one, installing the thing. Let's design in Figma and we're starting with pre-built structures. What is our goal? Our goal here is to build a simple hero section, a quick demo that'll look like this in the end. Now, the key to all of this in order for this to work, our designs need to have auto layout applied. And with all these pre-built structures, auto layout is already applied. And it's already responsive on all devices like desktop, tablet, mobile landscape, mobile portrait, and the ball that drops in Times Square midnight every New Year's Eve. So in the plugin, under where it says structure, let's create a new page. This is where our design will live. And then we'll make sure our new page is selected, that frame is selected, will go over and add a section plus container. This is our hero section. What do we do now? We'll take it further because we want to have kind of a side-by-side hero section. So this time with our container selected, let's go ahead and add the two column structure. And just like that, we created the structure of our entire hero section. Now we can add content and we're going to add for that content exactly three things, a heading, a paragraph and a button. So for our heading, let's do that by adding text. And for now, we'll do it outside of that frame and we'll just type it in, type in our heading. The second thing we'll add is a paragraph. We'll add some more text. And this time, we want more than just one word, so let's type that now. And of course, let's format our paragraph so it looks like a paragraph. We can always change this later. We can always adjust the design. The third and final piece of content, of course, is that button. So how do we do that? Well, with even more text, we'll call this one, we'll make the text say, sign up, except something like sign up would be better. But here's the problem. This button's not a button at all. It's just text. So let's add auto layout to our text. So with our text selected, we'll just right click and add auto layout. And when we added auto layout there, that took our text and put it in a frame. The frame has auto layout. And let's give our button some color. It can be any color for now. And let's also make sure we give it some breathing room. So it has some more breathing room. We can do that in our auto layout section here. That's all of our content. Now, we can just move all this content. We can move this content into the first column of our hero section. Now, it looks OK, but we might want to adjust the design a bit. For instance, we could clean this up real quick. We can select the first column, the first column here. And we'll make sure everything's left aligned, sort of top left aligned. The result? Well, it looks better. And all of this is changeable. If we want the heading and the paragraph to take up the full width of its container, we can just set the horizontal resizing to fill container. And it looks plain right now. So let's bring in an image, just drag an image from the desktop, right into Figma. And once we do, let's bring that to our second column. We can use the layers panel here for extra precision. And let's go ahead and size it so it looks better. OK, this is our main structure for our hero section. Is it perfect? Well, let's see. We'll submit this build under GREAMers' name to awards.com. Well, it winside of the day. That's up to the judges. So lobby now for GREAMers' chance at the spotlight. For us, here's what our hero section could look like if we style it in Figma. But of course, here's can be whatever you want it to be. All right, that was building our hero section using pre-built structures. Let's build it even faster with pre-built layouts. And just like pre-built structures, these pre-built layouts will also have auto layout applied. And they'll be responsive in web flow. So in our plugin under layouts, let's click to add a navbar. And we can go over and drag it. We can drag our navbar into the frame. Of course, making sure it goes to the top of our new page above our hero section. And just like that, our navbar is done. If we want to style it, let's just ask Siri to style it. Hey, Siri. Uh-huh. Style it. A style it is a hard, sharp, anatomical structure found in some invertebrates. For example, the word style or stomata style is used for the permitted piercing mouth or some nematodes and some nematodes. OK, our design is finished. Let's talk about getting it into web flow. This is a really important note. The plugin automatically translates your Figma frame names. These frame names that we can see here in the layers panel. These names become the names of classes in web flow. Why is that important? It's not. Except if your frames are named frame one, frame two, frame 30, those won't be ideal when you're managing styles in web flow. So consider naming your frames before going to web flow. Now, we covered that and so much more in detail over on web flow university. Things like HTML tags that you can use on headings, paragraphs. So check that out on web flow university if you haven't already. So for us to grab our design, all we have to do is select the full frame, which of course includes all the nested frames and what Lex calls. You can't even make this up. Layery goodness. And we'll go back over to the plugin thing. We'll make sure to choose our site. We'll do that in the drop down and copy to web flow. What do we do now? Let's go over to web flow. Now, this isn't just a blank site. It's the site we connected several minutes ago in Figma. So all we're going to do is click on the body. We'll make sure the body element is selected. And we'll press Command V on Mac, Control V on Windows. We'll paste. That's our design. And just like we mentioned before, it's already, as you can see, responsive in web flow. From here, of course, we have full control over everything HTML, everything CSS. And it's that way because our Figma design was converted to the industry standard Flexbox. The same CSS properties used on Apple.com. And Google.com and Stripe.com, and perhaps unsurprisingly, not Blockbuster.com. And this is just the beginning. To get up to speed on everything web flow, check out web flow university, where we have free courses, tons of documentation from the basics and fundamentals, all the way up to interactions, animations, including importing after effects animations, using a tool called body moving. Quick note. This is really important, even though we copied our design from Figma to web flow, changes in web flow are not going to get transferred back to Figma. This is a one-way street. And there's a ton of stuff, so much more to learn and explore with this plugin, like copying and pasting text styles or color styles directly from Figma to web flow. And of course, other best practices. So be sure to check that out on web flow university. So let's quickly recap. We installed the plugin and authenticated it with web flow. We made our hero section in Figma using pre-built structures. We quickly made our nav bar using pre-built layouts, and we pasted the whole thing inside web flow. And that's getting started with the Figma to web flow plugin.",

Unlike other design environments (like Photoshop or Sketch) that allow you to position elements anywhere in a given document, the web places elements in boxes that you control the positioning of to indirectly create layouts.

    "text": " This is a basic web page. It's plain, and we can obviously see it's made up of the heading, some filler paragraphs, a few images, and some allegedly small buttons. The box model is the simple idea that each of these HTML elements is treated as a box. You can imagine a boundary on each of them. These boxes sit next to each other and stack on top of one another depending on the properties we give them. It's helpful to think of web content, not like a PowerPoint slide where content is simply positioned wherever everything having a fixed width and height, but more like a word document, where content flows naturally from the top left of the page. That's the default on the web, too. Now at first, this might seem kind of rigid, but it actually gives us tremendous flexibility as we create layouts for all kinds of screen sizes and devices. They get again about PowerPoint. Looks okay on a wide screen like this. But what if we try to scale it down to a phone? Not great. Using CSS, we can style our elements each treated as a box to respond to all kinds of devices, their positions and sizing and spacing can respect each other, and that's great. The other great thing about the box model is that we can organize boxes inside of other boxes. This heading is a box. This paragraph is a box. That's a box box, a box box, a rock box, and of course, who could forget the box box? And since we've put all these boxes in another box, that box can be used to organize and style the boxes inside. Here's a practical example of a layout we might develop for the web. And since each of the elements inside are boxes, we can move and push content around using padding to affect the space inside of a box and margin to affect the space outside of a box in between that box and the boxes around it. The big takeaway here is that we can use these concepts to control the styling and the layout for each and every element.",

    "description": "It\u2019s that time of the year again: time for Gr\u00edmur to learn something new. That\u2019s why Micah kindly agreed to demonstrate how to not only set links to different Sections inside a page, but how to override the default scroll speed by controlling the data-scroll-time value.\n\nThe result? [Spoiler alert...] Gr\u00edmur is now powering his totally SFW photo site \u201cA History of Gr\u00edmur\u201d built entirely with Webflow and CSS grid, with the destination taking almost 45 seconds of scroll time to arrive. Is it too much? We think so. But it\u2019s up to you to decide.\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:28 - Add a Section ID\n00:38 - Set up your link\n00:59 - Configure the scroll time\n01:30 - Gr\u00edmur reveals his work \n\nLearn more: https://university.webflow.com/lesson/scroll-speed\n----------\r\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\r\n\r\nhttps://webflow.com\r\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\r\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

Oh yeah, don't mind me, I'm just doing my thing. What we'll show here is how to set up a link to a destination on the same page. And we'll control the animation speed so we can make it go really fast or really slow. Really slow. Oh, just keep going. I'm still just doing my thing. And all you need to do is three things. First, with our destination section selected, where we'll scroll to, let's go in our element settings. And at our unique ID, we'll name ours magic section. Second, with our button selected, the thing we want to make the link, let's go into our link settings. And we want to select our magic section destination. The page section we'll scroll to. And now, if we preview our link section, we can see its scroll to our magic section. You can see its scroll to our magic section. Oh, you can still hear me. Finally, if we want to change the default scroll speed, how fast the page scrolls to our destination, we want to select our page body. And then, go over to our element settings, where we can add a single custom attribute to change everything, data scroll time. And for our value, any number smaller than one, like .5 or .25, is going to scroll faster, much faster. While a larger number, like 10, will scroll much slower. A lot slower. A lot slower.

you can go ahead and ask those questions here as well but share your read only link for your project in a in this form that our moderators lacy and matthew will link at the top of the chat all right so um in the agenda for today we're going to bring in our customer support team member of the month uh our guest and he will help answer the frequently asked question of the month and then lastly we will open up the floor to answer those q&a's and project links uh that you've already queued up for us we'll answer those at the end all right so without further ado let's welcome our guest customer support manager Drew Schaffer welcome Drew you know thanks for having me yes yes thank you so much so um yeah uh you are one of our uh support team managers from the the a pack region you're actually in New Zealand right now yes that is correct it is bright and early well not bright and still dark so i just want to say thank you thank you so much for waking up really early to be on the stream and helping our community out so um first well what is your day-to-day like when it comes to being a customer support manager here at webflow yeah so um as a customer support manager i have a few different kind of responsibilities that i look after um i've got a team of different customer support agents that uh you know i work with and and help uh you know in order to help our community and our customers yeah i also you know uh work on some initiatives here and there to help improve um our relationship with our customer so um you know being able to bring in those uh issues or questions they may have and then relaying them to our product teams uh efficiently and making sure we're getting the right information um and then also helping out uh whether it's uh in our our support cues or um in the forum uh answering you know customer questions when possible yeah and i noticed that your your team has redesigned the support website so congratulations to you and your team for for doing that it's like so clear on where to find help and how to contact you uh you and your team so yeah good job to you and your team for for doing that um thanks the other question uh because i just want to introduce you to the community is uh besides customer support what do you do for your hobbies like what else do you do after after work yeah um i am a bit of a home brewer so i enjoy brew my own beer um i actually currently have a keg under my desk um so easy tap access there um but uh yeah it's just uh one of the things i i i do uh yeah one of my one of my current favorite hobbies i i i'm involved in it must be so intricate like um like i don't know what home brewing is like and so like uh there must be so many processes uh in like i feel like it's such a science to do like is it down to like the milliliter or something or like okay i have to put this much of this ingredient and then this much and it's like a balance like what does that like yeah so there are different ways to do it you know you can do it kind of the easier way uh which is all you know extracted and a lot of has done for you but then you can also do it the uh more traditional way which um you know there are there are some things that you know adding in just a you know couple grams of a different type of grain can can bring out different flavors um or even different hops that you could add in so it's not like perfect you don't have to get it down to the milliliter but uh you know adding in uh just a little bit of something can actually make a big difference okay so do you have like a favorite flavor or something that you've you've made and have you named it yet i have not named it but i am a uh a sazon fan so a nice Belgian sazon something yeah a bit farmhouse ale yeah it's kind of my my go-to that i try to make but still have it mastered it's quite a difficult one so oh seems interesting okay so um thank you so much again for being here so uh the reason why we bring a customer support team member onto these streams is i asked them to find the frequently asked question of the month so what is the most common questions that come into the support inbox and instead of just emailing uh the community one-on-one we make a video to help everyone who may have that same question in the future so let's go to our frequently asked question of the month and Drew can you tell us what that question is and how do we solve it sure thing um so we often get a lot of questions around search engine optimization uh or sharing your site so uh we actually are going to do FAQs of the month um so just a few kind of quick questions that we get um that we'll go into and then try to answer so first off you know one question we get a lot is how can I control the content that is shown on a Google search result or any search engine result uh next how do I adjust the content that's displayed when I share my website on something like Facebook or LinkedIn uh third what do I do if I want to remove my page or content from a search engine result and then somewhat in line with that is what do I put in my robots.txt file so got it there in the SEO tab what in the world is it and what do I put in there yeah very very important because like how can you find your site even after this published because just publishing doesn't make it available to everyone it's like how can people find find my site exactly and so that's what we're going to look into um so yeah let's jump right into that first question how can I control the content shown on Google search results okay um so as you mentioned first off yeah you do have to publish your site if you don't publish it obviously never really found um but once you do um it actually may still take some time before anything shows up and so that's actually one of the first keys is sometimes you just have to wait um it may take search engines anywhere from a few hours to a few months before they fully crawl and index your site there are some things you can do to speed that up by using the tools that the search engines provide um but regardless of that eventually it will get found it will get crawled which is crawling is kind of the process of where it just searches your site the search engine looks through all the pages and sees what what content is there yeah we're going to talk to clients I'm like they're asking like hey when is my site going to get on Google and I'm like it's up to Google I can't just call them up and say hey do it now so we it's a mystery so but um there is uh yeah some things we can do that once they do actually find it yeah we can uh inform it what to say for what to index about our site and that's what um if we take a look actually at the designer um and we take a look at our pages so here I've got my site and all the different pages and Google is going to crawl it they're going to start looking through these they're going to be saving random information about my site by the way great name for a website thank you one day the brewery will exist but until then I'll just put it out there in the universe yeah um if we head over to the about page here I got my site settings um and I scroll down we have this section here called SEO settings and so what this is it's a uh two fields our title tag and our meta description and we're able to put content in this which then informs the search engine what to save and what to display when someone searches for our site now a little disclaimer sometimes Google won't show this information uh they may adjust what they display based on what someone searches uh but most of the time this is what's going to show so in this case I'll just copy something in here yeah there we go we can even see a little preview about what it would look like on a search engine so um if you have a template it might be good if you purchase a template uh to double check this information a lot of times it's actually just default information from the template yeah yeah I've seen some websites that they're wondering like how come my templates a title tag or meta description is still the same and they forget that step so yeah it's very important to check that now definitely and then I guess the next question kind of comes in is with CMS um so you know if I was going to the CMS here and go down to my SEO settings uh I could pay something in here but uh it's gonna be the same on every one of my blog posts um so that's obviously not what I want uh so in order to customize this uh well you can do is go into the CMS and go into your CMS settings for your collection we're gonna add in two new fields so first field we're just gonna call uh meta title and the next one maybe do a multiple line meta description save save collection I can now go into uh my blog post and type them in um and if I go into my page settings now scroll down uh I can use this little ad field section here and put in here my meta title and my meta description and so that it'll be dynamic for each individual blog post cool so now let's go on to that next question which was how do I adjust the content that's displayed when I share my website on something like Facebook or LinkedIn uh now all that content once again is easily accessible here in our site page settings uh if we go into our page settings again and scroll down down past the SEO settings we're gonna see this section called open graph settings so open graph is what these platforms use when you share your site on them uh you may often see that image that comes along with it as well as um you know just a little uh bit of text and so here I'm actually copying um over down from my SEO title tag and meta description so you just keep them the same which is nice and easy um and same thing if you had a template some of of these may have been pre-filled uh specifically the image field here so there is a an image that you can add in here and you can actually just take one from uh your uh asset panel uh if you just want to grab any of these images you can copy the the link there go into your page settings again and paste that image and and so that you kind of have a preview of what is going to be shown if you share your site now uh make sure if you make any adjustments here to publish and it may still take some time before actually those platforms pick up this new information uh one other tip actually about uh sharing uh some browsers will use what's called your canonical tag when you share okay uh now if you are using kennonicals um we actually have a feature in the SEO tab of your project settings if you scroll down you have a global kennonical tag URL and so uh if you're using this feature uh it will automatically create a canonical URL for each page which is the canonical is basically just it's an official URL's where you can think of it and so you're telling uh the search engines this is the URL of my page uh and if you if you are using this feature make sure it's in the right format because if not when you share your site uh it may cost some issues and not share properly so the key one that we actually see a lot is that customers don't have the HTTPS at the start or they have a trailing slash at the end so if you have a trailing slash or don't have HTTPS uh you know make sure you set that up properly so when you share your site uh it will get shared properly but do not know cool let's go to the next question so um what do I do if I want to remove a page from a search engine result you know sometimes that happens we're we're building a site in my case here I have my my secret recipes I don't want anyone to to find this page I think you're right published in the first place uh we see a net wait it's all in code though well what is your secret what is your secret you need to have your Dakota ring and then you can interpret it but um if we go into our site page settings again uh we scroll down here uh we're gonna keep going now one thing I want to point out is there's a section here called site search settings this has nothing to do with whether or not your site will be found by search engines or not so sometimes people may say oh I want to exclude this page done I don't have to worry about the showing up it's still gonna show up that's gonna show up that's from the other feature that we have where people can search internally correct yeah so um every webflow website comes with a kind of built-in search engine feature for your site and so that's that's what this is um using so that really will have no impact on this yeah but what we will do is go down to the custom code section and here the custom code section all you have to do is paste in one line of code and that will inform search engines that hey I don't want this page to be saved I don't want you to save information about this page that's called a meta directive so I'll paste that in there uh all it is it says meta name robots so we're saying search engines which they call robots content no index so I don't want anything on this page indexed um now if they previously indexed it and then the next time you know search engine finds your site of seizes code it will remove it from their index so this is the most efficient way to have your page not indexed uh still it's gonna take a while right for them to take down yeah it still may take some time and that's why sometimes using their tools can help speed things up because you can submit it to be recalled and and hopefully that maybe takes it down a bit sooner okay um now similar to the you know meta title a meta description what about when it comes to our CMS collection pages um you know here uh if I was to go down into my custom code section here and put that that meta directive in um that's gonna make itself every single one of my blog posts is not indexed maybe there's just one I don't want indexed how do I do that well uh similar to using the the fields that we did previously we're gonna do the same here so for now I'll just leave that uh meta directive in my custom code but I'll head back over to my CMS go to my settings let's add in the new field uh in this case I'm gonna use actually an option and I'm gonna call this meta directives really for me to spell sorry okay and we're gonna say here no index we're gonna add another option index and you can add in more here as well uh if you were to google just like meta directives there are a bunch of different ones in here that you could actually use and different combinations but for this say I'll just put in those two and we'll save our our collections so now I can go into my my item here scroll down and I can select something for my meta directive going back into my page settings then and there we go page settings for my blog posts scroll down so rather than writing no index here I'll just remove that I'm gonna add in a field and I'm gonna pick my meta directive so now that'll be dynamic so uh whichever page it's on it will take the appropriate field so for the other pages though that you want them to be indexed um would you have to add index to all of those like you have to go back to all your blog posts and say index this index this index this um you would have to yeah um in this case if I added that field in later um but it doesn't have to take that long uh we do have a new feature recently right that would help with that um which is the uh upload uh import cm at uh c sb yeah yeah csv and then you can upload the csv and update the um blog posts rather than having to delete them all and re upload them so yeah okay yeah that brings us to our final question then is what do I put in my robots.txt file you may have heard someone say hey if you want something not to show up on on google you need to do something in that file well let's open up our our site settings here um and on our SEO tab we have this section here called robots.txt um the robots.txt file is the first thing that a search engine generally is going to look at on your site so it it's you can kind of say it's like a map of what they will uh or the instructions of what they would need to do on your site and so here at the top it's the first thing we're going to say is user agent and we're going to use here what's called a wild card which means we're telling every user every search engine what to do and in this case on my site i'm saying disallow nothing so you would tell it here that you want it to not allow it to crawl something so um in this case i'm telling it i would i'm allowing it to crawl everything i want it to i want my site to show up on google but maybe you have a folder or a of pages or a CMS collection you don't want indexed um and so here this is a good way rather than going in each individual page and adding that meta directive you can right here tell it uh tell search engines to just not index a certain area of your site now the using the meta directives is definitely preferred because it is a bit more solid uh this is actually just telling it not to crawl the page not not to index it um so it is recommended to use the meta directives but uh you can also do it this way and so i could say something like your FAQs and now if i had an FAQs folder none of that is going to be indexed uh but in most cases if you just want your site indexed you want everything to uh to show up on on a search you would type in this user-agent and then a star for wild card and then disallow uh colon nothing and uh if i was to actually go to my custom domain here and go to uh site met oh not site map um they're the one the box and we can see it right here user uh agent uh disallow maybe you can zoom in on this there we go uh disallow nothing and then site map uh it actually instantly links your site map there so uh you don't actually have to type in the location of your site map into your robot sub-txt file you can just uh leave that there uh as is so just your disallow statements okay and that's it so hopefully uh some of those uh questions were were yeah beneficial and helpful to you all um yeah and uh yeah definitely check out there's more on the webflow blog actually about a lot of different things you can do with search engine optimization uh well thank you for those tips and again uh this just helps you with your uh with your SEO when google and other search engines pass by your site and crawl it and we cannot control those robots it is up to them but there's things like the the google uh search tool or search console i don't believe change it comes from times yeah um that can help speed things up but again it's up to them it's up to them and that's what you can tell your clients as well uh you can do your best to set up everything up in webflow but it's up to google thank you thank you so much Drew for no problem explaining all of that uh let's go ahead and uh again if you have any questions about SEO uh about web design or webflow go ahead and start putting them in the chat and our moderators Lacey and Matthew will help pass them over to me and Drew if you have any questions about your project specifically you can go ahead and submit that through the link at the top that's been at the top of the live chat and uh yeah if you're watching recording of this come by to the next live support hour so you can get your questions answered live okay so let's get into our Q&A Drew are you ready for some of these questions let's do it all right okay our first one is from Ashish um okay i have set the global canonical tag but need to change the canonical tag of a specific page how do you do that huh that's possible so it's not possible if using the global canonical tag so in that situation you would actually have to um manually add your canonical tag to each page and then go in and take that one page and make a difference so in the in your scenario you would be best not using the the global one okay so the global one is kind of like adding that that custom code tag to every page with that one field but you still have the option to do it yourself through the the page settings correct yeah you would just have to go into the page settings custom code in the head and and paste in a manual canonical tag there okay all right hopefully to answer your question Ashish all right next one uh shashi is asking can or how do we manage SEO for the Hindi language i think i think i mean i think it's basically just characters inside of a input field so can you just put that inside of inside of a SEO meta title and meta description i would i would think so i mean i know it does work with you know other Latin-based languages um so it should work with with any character in my my guess yeah yeah well go ahead and try it out and again um you can go through the go through the uh SEO blog or SEO tips that you can find over at webflow.com slash blog and also university.webflow.com just search for SEO and follow those instructions and if that doesn't work or you need more help you can just contact the the support team uh drew in the rest of the support team members will help you out all right next one Jordan Sinclair hi this is a portfolio website i'm making for my brother Ian i'm not finished yet but i was hoping you could take a look i was wondering if there's a way to have a model slider open after clicking on a project and all the project pages currently to get to that page i have to scroll down to the project section and click on more projects i really appreciate your help um okay so let me check out the website i'm going to go to my screen here right so uh again i was wondering if there is a way to have a model slider open after clicking on a project a model slider so like click on this oh okay i see so interesting back button okay i see so a model slider open um model slider so i think the easier thing to do Ian is just to use the light box feature that web flow already has and so you can put um as many images in that light box as you want even youtube videos so people will have a control to do it themselves and if you haven't played around with the light box uh let me show you real quick um i'm going to add say a gallery and each gallery right here has a a light box and this light box um you can add media into here so again you can add a trans scroll there's a nice scroll okay scroll he's not working okay there we go so you can add uh images or videos there we go images or videos uh interior light boxes and you can add as many as you need and so when it opens up well bad demo because i have nothing in here i don't have any images in this yeah i don't have any images in here but when you put images in here they will come up into your website so um if you can link me your read only link then i can give you a better demo um actually drew can you give a demo on on light boxes real quick on your screen since you have images let's um take a look here uh so yeah so one one thing you could do um as well is um let me just drag in a collection list let's show you this it's going to be just randomly on my page here and i know you you were saying you were doing it with your projects you so you could actually choose your in this case i'll just use my blog posts um and then within each of your collection items um you'll add in that light box element so scrolling down light box and so now you see i have all these so you can design obviously how you'd like with you know with the name of your project and then in the settings we're going to get our media from our blog posts or your your uh projects and i'll say main image um and i'll actually then set my image itself in this case to the main image and so now i have all these different images showing up here back in my light box settings i can then group these here uh and just call them yeah project a gallery and so now each of these images are all linked within the same light box so clicking on that i can scroll through them all yeah so it acts like a slider and it is a a modal so yeah thank you so much true in jordan hopefully that answers your question and keep going on your webflow journey all right next one stacey is asking uh does 301 redirects help SEO yes yeah so um i guess they don't make it worse yeah if um if you have a page that uh you know maybe our URL or link that once existed a 301 redirect definitely will help because i will you know make it set if someone ever landed on that page it would resolve to another one um which then will help your overall uh domain you know authority you know the search engines will see hey every time someone goes to your site they get where they want to go they don't go to a 404 page so that's yeah that's good yeah you don't want 404 um pages especially when a robot crawls or site you don't want any 404 because that that does downrank you a bit right yeah yes yeah definitely and so a lot of search engines use what's called domain authority so uh they have all the some weird ranking system they use and and the more authoritative that's right one um your domain is the more likely you are to show up on a google search or the higher you would show up okay yeah yeah it's like mail forwarding you know you move uh from one place to another and you want your mail to forward to the correct place you don't want that person then in that old place you just live at get why am i getting this mail from another person so yes all right next one from Keith i have a client looking to separate a project into two separate languages we glott is not working well do you have suggestions on how to let google know that it's the same site but a different language within webflow oh so there's people um there's community uh members who are uh creating websites with folders like for french they have a folder FR English EN and so forth and they're duplicating their pages for those languages so they're doing it very manually if they're not using like something like we glott or another translation uh third party integration so uh yeah do you have any suggestions on helping google know i personally haven't dealt much with um yeah we glott and the different yeah different language content you know search engines would crawl all of that information and i do believe there are ways you can inform you know search engines of what information is uh you know what language that information is so i guess you could also maybe look into using something like schema depending on the content that could also prove beneficial um yeah i'm never really uh work personally worked with much like yeah multiple language uh sites and and being indexed yeah same here same here um but i'm just i just did a quick google search for like an HTML tag um i was hoping to define something like like a meta tag or something uh for for language but um what what i'm seeing on my screen right here is you can add like uh f-lang is a HTML attribute so i don't know yeah sorry we couldn't help Keith but uh go ahead and ask on the forums discourse.webflow.com and uh maybe a community member can help out uh yeah so next one from the infinite door i was wondering is there a way anyway to have a collection item act as a tab instead of having to link to a CMS page kind of like Netflix collection item act as a tab i need an example of this a collection item maybe it's it's kind of like i guess using like collection like a collection list is like a almost like a a menu um where so you would have you know your collection list of different categories and you would tab between them oh yeah so um yeah that that is a that could be a thing um uh that i'm thinking in my head okay i think i can do a demo of this uh life so let's let's try it i'm going to create a collection i'm going to call it categories great collections and so these categories will be my tabs okay so let's create the sample items rounded and rounded goes and we're doing it live all right so wow oh well while it's going i'm going to try to go ahead and let's make blog posts create collection and let me make more okay can't let's make sure what's going on let me refresh this okay and i still okay there we go all right let's create five great those please there we go let's create um 20 of these all right so let me go here and uh let's go ahead let's and so oh excuse you sorry scared me okay so um let's see here how would i do this yeah so to me it would be you would have a page that has a collection list so you'd have to not use the tabs feature but recreate it to look like it's tabs so here's what i mean so i'm going to go to categories and i'm going to make this flex with the new gap for flex yeah 20 and we'll center that and let's add a link a text link we're going to make this really basic looking okay so the name and then um we're going to go to the category page so current category and so this is our first page we go to and then under that we'll have another collection list and this one will be the blog posts and let's make this grid with three columns and we'll just put the the name of each text link and this will go to each blog post there we go let's move this away okay so we have the tabs up here and let's pretend that we're and these are these are all the collection lists but if you click on say this one let me design this a little bit so it's more apparent shall we just make a button but stay with me there you go all right so okay so we have all of our blog posts here this is all of our blog posts but if i click on this if i click on this it'll go to its category page and so now we're on the category page for ipsum okay so this would only show we use the filters right here to only show filters where oh i forgot to make a reference i'm going too fast in my head this is actually a great uh great way to do it nothing as well like this is actually the customer support portal and you go to support.webflow.com it's built in webflow and that's exactly how each of the different topics are filtered so you can narrow down and it's just you know it's swapping between different CMS pages category this is what i missed have the category and now they are linked to those categories let me add those 20 okay wait like when you click on a Netflix movie it pops up that movies in a semi full screen without linking to another page oh okay so i'm so i'm going about this demo wrong i had i had an idea but that's not what the infinidore was looking for oh that's that's more comp i feel like that's going to take custom code and yeah i don't think i can do that real quickly the infinidore yeah no i think i think you're right it would require some sort of custom code to to make it work for the way that there can't be a asking there i mean with time uh you can i think you can create a Netflix style page with collections uh i have not done that myself but there there has to be a way there has to be a way with advanced custom code that you can add to webflow but yeah yeah all right um next question uh Stacy again uh question for Drew do you have any tips or resources for ensuring my site has good SEO right um well there's actually within the webflow designer um you have the um audit panel which uh well it's not designed for SEO specifically um is very useful in seeing generally you know some things that are important to search engines uh because the same things that are important to you know for accessibility are important to search engines um so going to your audit panel i can see right here that i'm missing all of these images don't have any alt text so my site is in need of some some attention um and so you know search engines are going to are going to find that because they're you know not a human being so they need to know what an image is uh so you know adding alt text is beneficial and helps for your search engines because excuse me sorry it makes the content more relevant so you know you're defining a picture and there are some ways you can also include some some of your keywords in there of what you're trying to search because the image is relevant so if in this case i'm a brewery this is a picture of my brewery i just included the word brewery again on my site because that's what the picture is um and so that's beneficial um so you know using the the audit panel um as well as uh there is a uh great just kind of i i generally just work off of checklists um so just yeah going through um i think there's actually a really good one on the on the webflow blog i think it's like a nine step checklist or something uh that you just go through um that you know basically check your audit panel uh check your your meditidal and description um but i do also recommend using the search engine um tools that that nelson mentioned earlier it was a google search console um they help look at your site and we'll tell you kind of like those areas that like hey these pages have some problems or these pages are slow um there's another tool out there from google uh page speed insights so you can put your site in there and it will scan it um tell you how fast it loads the faster a site the more search engines like it yeah and so i can give you some tips there to hey this this image is the size of the moon you should probably compress it a bit and your site will load faster yes yes and for image uh compression there's this free tool out there called tiny png.com that i use personally all the time so uh yeah when you're a client it's like i want this photo to be high quality and it gives you something that's like over four megabytes and you're like oh but uh you know if you size it down and then run it through that compressor you can get it down to under maybe under a megabyte so that really helps not only with the loading of your page for all the people who are going to it but also on sio yeah maybe there's a yeah definitely a misconception about good quality images on the internet that you know if you're printing it it's different versus if you're displaying it on a web page it doesn't need to be four megabytes exactly exactly all right next one from medium studio how do you incorporate monster insights or something like that or do you just just check you over google dashboard sorry have zero knowledge about sio don't worry sio is still something i'm learning as well so um yeah yeah i'm not sure what monster insight is but do you know true no i think it's a let me just double check if i'm correct um hey yeah it's uh at the plug-in or google analytics um here i'll just i'll bring it over to my my screen here um here we go um yeah so it you know it helps along with google analytics to find certain things um however it is a yeah it's a it's a WordPress plugin so um using google analytics out of the box would essentially solve your problem so you really wouldn't need to use anything like this if you want to get those insights um yeah i think this plug-in looks like it's beneficial for those on you know WordPress sites because you can just do everything in WordPress you don't have to go to google analytics it's kind of what it's doing um but uh using the full power of google analytics you're probably going to be better off than using um yeah something like that okay yeah and and there's other tools out there if you want to drill in drill down deeper i mean i think there's like i've heard of things like mix panel and hot jar and um there's uh i think there's a no code one no code analytics or something like that there's lots of tools out there that usually what they do is give you a code snippet just like google analytics they give you a code snippet and say add this to the head tag of all of your sites uh sorry all of your web pages and you can do that through the custom code section of your of your project and so uh maybe that's what monster insights is doing with that you know uh with their plug-in but yes you can do that with web flow with um other tools like it all right uh from next one is from peter hello peter a long time fan and community member of web flow very long time um he's asking how important are heading levels for SEO i see that really big websites skip heading levels everywhere i usually follow this role very strictly but i want another perspective thanks good question yeah no really good question i personally has have always been a fan of heading levels um when it comes to search engines um i think it's one of those things too where it is with how you know i say like how often is it google gonna crawl my website it's a mystery uh and i think even with heading levels it is a mystery if it really makes a difference but it doesn't hurt and it does also help from my understanding the categorization of indexing on their part so um specifically with you know your uh h1 tag um and then down to the h2 and so they're able to break up the content a bit better um when they index your site so i know personally it's something i always do and i do think it is important for search engines to to grab that information um in that in that manner and it helps with uh xx accessibility as well so um yeah page readers you know like like in far you can do like uh remove all the what i love about it it's just a reader version and it removes all the ads and everything and just get what you need so yeah headings are really important for that okay thanks for answering that one um and just remind it to everyone if you have any questions about your projects uh go ahead and share your read only link uh with me in the form that's pinned at the top and i will look through your site answer questions uh that you may have or any issues that you may have and you want me to answer it live this is the time for you all right uh next question from Fernando do you recommend making a schema for every webflow page oh yeah schema for sio yeah um definitely recommended but it does take some time so uh if you if you have the time and and you know it's something you want to add it's not going to hurt it's only going to make things better um it's nice even with uh cms pages you can dynamically add in sections of the schema um just like we did with that meta directive uh you can you know with certain fields insert content and so you can do the same there uh so yeah i mean it's it's definitely recommended if you have the time i would say you know historically on sites i've done and worked on um i always try to make sure i have at least on my home page and on my blog pages so there's kind of like changing pages or really good to have it on because you know search engines are going to pick up on the new content i have yeah um and they're going to add that in and then um yeah my home page that's the main page i want people to find so making sure that one is is has everything it needs is is what i want to do yeah yeah yeah take the time if you really wanted to to rank up higher you know do everything you can including schema and i just googled on my my screen webflow schema and i found this uh form post so yeah you can find a lot and i'm going to link it in chat right now you can find a lot in discourse.webflow.com and sit in um or Ezra is uh showing you how to do it from scratch and just like what you're talking about you can link dynamically all that schema data into webflow and so yeah like right here just part just image you can just like you're doing with the meta directives you can pull in data from your collection and put it into the schema especially for blog posts so yeah yeah check this post out and uh thank you for nando for the question uh let me see here do we have anything else yeah um fenando saying only um only 10% of people do schema and i guess that's more opportunity for if you're adding schema you get ranked higher because you're giving the robots yeah and there's certain actually things that schema can be really good for too um things like uh i mean depends on what your website is about but if you have a uh you know recipe website there is specific recipe schema and using that will help your recipes show up you know if you google me and everyone's done it you know i want to look for this type of food or this this meal tonight and you know those recipes spliter kind of shows up that's how you get into areas like that is by using schema. Oh okay and um i'm guessing it works for businesses too how they show their business card on the side when inver you're looking for a certain type of like a restaurant yeah yeah that definitely has some play i think some of those also get linked in with google my business that was called um but yeah they work in in conjunction so you know you're it all helps like and sometimes google will say hey this is the business this is their schema on their page i'm going to take that information and display it accordingly so it doesn't hurt to have it all yeah all right all right next question let's see see uh what are some black hat SEO techniques that you see people make the mistake of implementing black hat um black hat meaning like bad SEO techniques i'm thinking that's yeah um i don't one thing you do see is like you know what they call keyword stuffing um where people just put their keywords like to the extreme where it starts to get not natural and then also like abusing things like um alt text so you know alt text is not made for search engines it's made for accessibility and so while you can definitely use it to your advantage um you know as i said earlier if you have a picture of your brewery and it's a or whatever it is you're your business it's yeah include that word in there because it's not it's going to help but don't you know just put in there you know uh you know 100 keywords that then you know means nothing to those using the screen reader so that's that's one i have seen that is definitely not not recommended is yeah don't keyword stuff yeah yeah most definitely like just keep it simple straight to the point and help people out it's not just the robots that you're talking to but it's mainly humans yeah exactly yeah all right um let's see here very from ksm very nice moment for life thanks so much uh all right and yeah i think that's all the questions Fernando saying great thanks again you're welcome happy to help um there we go i think that's about it yeah so let's go ahead and go let's close this out um thank you oh wait one more let's get one more uh a sheesh is asking how to implement breadcrumbs on all the pages in a buttery smooth way mmm bread and butter i like the sound of that so i haven't had breakfast yet so i'm just well right after this right after this yeah breadcrumbs i know there's breadcrumbs um now i'm getting hungry on university the webflow.com let let me check let's go to like spacing yeah so on my whoa okay yeah sorry the musical is playing on my screen but on university.webflow.com i just clicked on a random lesson for spacing and right here this is the breadcrumbs that uh a sheesh is talking about and yeah this can be done with a webflow CMS um yeah i wouldn't know how to how to build it right off top my head but yes there is a way to do that oh thank you Matthew Matthew put in the the chat right now that there is a right up on the webflow blog on how to do that oh and he wrote it perfect yeah it's

    "description": "Variable fonts allow you to add multiple variations of a font with a single file, making it possible to create more dynamic and flexible designs on the web. With variable fonts, you can add new fonts to your designs in Webflow and control various aspects of the font, such as size, weight, and slant, using axes. Additionally, you can add transitions and interactions on hover and mouse move, allowing you to create even more engaging and dynamic designs. \n\nOverall, Variable fonts is a powerful way for web designers looking to create more flexible and dynamic designs.\n\n00:00 \u2013 Intro\n00:43 \u2013 Add\n00:59 \u2013 Axes\n01:25 \u2013 Transitions\n02:05 \u2013 Interactions\n\nTo learn more visit Webflow University \u2192 https://university.webflow.com/lesson/variable-fonts\n----------\nGet started with Webflow: https://wfl.io/2r7cVUW\nJoin the Webflow Community: https://webflow.com/community\n\nhttps://webflow.com\nhttps://twitter.com/webflow\nhttps://facebook.com/webflow",

    "text": " Very Buffonts. In addition to being visually interesting, people always ask, yes, but what practical value do they have? It's a good point, and sometimes aesthetics do add a lot of value. But instead of loading tons of weights separately, you upload only one font. And variable fonts often have smaller font sizes because of it. There's broad browser support, and they let me do something like this. In this lesson, we'll cover how to add them, how to control all kinds of axes, like slant and weight and optical size, how to add animated transitions, and how to control them with interactions to make someone's brain melt into pure liquid joy. Adding, at any time, I can go in, add fonts, and upload a custom font. I want to select a font file to upload, and I just upload. And that's it. Back in the designer, I can choose the font. I just load it from the dropdown thing. Second part, axes. If I go in under more type options, I can see font variations. And when I add them, the first variation loads up. Now, I can go into the dropdown and select another axis, but I can just click and drag and adjust along that axis. If I want to add another axis, another property to control, I can combine them however I want and do whatever. Third part, animated transitions. Since I set my axis controls here, I can go to, let's say, hover and make other changes here. I'm just changing the style so it's different on hover. If I escape out, hover over, hover out, hover over, let's animate it. With the elements selected, in none, I'll go down and add a transition. And just like I can transition basically any CSS property, let's transition font variations. I can control the whatever you know the deal. And now, hover over, hover out, hover over, that's right. I have a transparent mouse. Fourth part, interactions. Here's a heading on a page. I added a variable font, but I haven't done anything else to my styling. In interactions, I can add any type of interaction here. In this example, I'll add one to mouse move on the page. So when the mouse is moving over the page anywhere in the viewport, you'll play this animation. What kind of animation? The one we're making in this very video. And since axis left and right, then Y is up and down. With my heading selected, I can just add a point. Let's do vertical. So when the Y position is at 0%, basically at the top, we can add font variation. And just add the axis. Let's make the way here super thin when the mouse is at the top. And I'll add one more at the bottom at 100% I want to add a font variation. And I'll go in and add the axis for weight. But this time, I'll make the weight super heavy. If I switch on live preview, I can hover over the viewport and I'm continuously animating the heading on mouse move. Top 0%, bottom 100%. But that's it. We can add a variable font by uploading a variable font. And we can choose it from the little drop down thing. We can control all sorts of axes by adding axes and controlling them. We can control different states like hover and even add transitions to animate those state changes. And finally, we can add interactions that control all kinds of axes, like mouse move controlling the weight of the font or the slant of a font or the position of the tiny star that lives atop the screen.",

    "text": " Hello and welcome. My name is Grace Walker. I'm an independent designer and webflow expert working to build websites that are visually stunning and technically sound. My career has steadily been shrinking in team size since I started working. I started my career working in-in-house for a mid-size creative team for a very large government corporation. I then worked at a small studio with half a dozen team members and now I work on my own. When I first started freelancing, I thought that working solo would be a temporary stepping stone. When I got busy, the advice that I received from peers and media was constantly telling me that I had to hire other designers and team members in order to scale and grow my business into an infinite creative building an agency seemed like the only goal to pursue. But what if it wasn't my goal? I've made the choice to stay small on purpose and I believe that choice has been key for my ability to thrive as a webflow solo printer. I share this story not because I think that the agency model is wrong, but to help creatives understand that there are other options that can be right for them to build a creative career. Let's start with the obvious question, why stay small? For me, there are three key reasons. Simplicity, flexibility, and control. Simplicity. There is only so much energy in a day and only so many days that we get. I feel so lucky that I found something I love to do for work and I want to spend as much time and energy as possible getting really good at that thing. Stay small means I can focus on my craft without having to add extra energy for things like team meetings, direction, and management. I have simple goals and I want a simple life and stay small removes many of the complex parts of running a business. Flexibility. A primary reason I went freelance in the first place was to have more flexibility in my career because I only have to worry about my time and income. I can spend more time doing things that I love, like taking Mondays off to ride my bike in the mountains, taking extended breaks, or working from home when I want to. I also have flexibility in the type of work that I do. I can work solo, collaborate with other designers, contract for agencies, or create products of my own. I can also pivot easily when my clients need change and move quickly to help them reach their goals. Finally, control. I find relief in knowing that I'm in control of my career. If I want to make more money, that's on me. If I want to take a break, that's on me. If I made a mistake, that's only on me. Both in the wins and losses, I find relief in knowing that I'm in control of the direction, pace, and reputation of my business. Because I have limited capacity, this also means that I have great control in who I choose to work with. I never have to say yes to work because I depend on a certain quantity, but I can say yes based on the quality of the project and client. These reasons are at the core of my values for staying small. But how do I actually put them into practice? I think I could talk about this all day long, but right now I'm going to run through my top five tips to thrive as a web flow solo printer. Number one, wow, your clients. This is the core of where web flow comes into my success. This is my top tip because it really is the base for the rest. The pursuit of great work is the foundation for any successful creative career, solo, or otherwise. While in your clients means going above and beyond their expectations, web flow is so key here because it opens up so many more possibilities for designers. As a freelancer, I can design and build a fully functioning, beautiful website for a client, similar to what a larger team may be able to do with custom code, and I can often do it faster with more flexibility and control. For example, I recently had a client who moved their product launch up by two weeks and wanted to have their website live sooner than my initial timeline. Because I have flexibility in my schedule, I said, let's do it. I worked to build the site out and ensure it was live for their launch. My client was thrilled and I was happy that I could deliver something above and beyond their expectations. However, while in your clients doesn't always have to relate to your creative output, I strive to wow clients on even the more mundane aspects of a project like scheduling, communication, and content organization. Some examples of this could be following up every meeting with a clear action item list, providing a clear structure for content population, or simply delivering things when you said you would. While in your clients is possible because of the flexibility of working solo and the control you have to say yes when opportunities present themselves. Number two, celebrate your work. Honestly, I debated putting this first but you need work to celebrate, so I put it second. I cannot stress enough how important it is for creators to celebrate their work. Unlike at a studio or a large agency, there is no one else that is going to promote your work, strategize about publicity or submit to industry awards. This can be a really hard thing to get over. Some of the most talented designers that I know really struggle to share their work because they view it as boastful or egotistical or be a little bit cringy, but clients can't hire you unless they know you exist. Celebrating your work can look like sharing when you sign a new client, posting your latest build, talking about your process, or sharing testimonials from your clients. I recently shared a thread of websites that I built on Twitter. The post garnered over 130,000 impressions, 2,500 profile visits, and 9,300 engagements. While not all of my posts or your posts or any ones are going to have that kind of traction, when something resonates with people, it's a great way to get your name out there. The week after I posted this, I received 10 new inquiries for work, compared to previous weeks, which averaged about 2 to 3 each. I'd also like to add here that I think it's worthwhile to show up as yourself on social media, not as a studio or a nickname, but for me as Grace Walker. People want to work with people and getting to know you can humanize your work. I've found Twitter to be a great platform to share about work, but I know others prefer different platforms. Celebrating your work leads to more visibility, usually more leads, and more control over the work that you say yes to. Number three, be selfish. When you're starting out, you take on all of the work that comes your way. I definitely did this, but once you have a steady stream of projects, it's really essential to be selfish with your time. I started to realize this after the first year of freelancing that if I wasn't careful, my career was going to be swept in a direction that I didn't anticipate, simply because I wasn't prioritizing what I wanted, I was just saying yes to anything that came my way. Being selfish often involves a lot of reflection. What are my values? Does this project align with those values? If I say yes to this, what am I saying no to? I'll try to practice this often, and if I'm not excited about a project, even though I know I could do a good job, I'll say no. This could be due to the industry, the chemistry with the client, or just to kind of build that I'm not interested in. I also try to think about this from the client's perspective. A client deserves to work with someone who is excited about their project, and if that's not me, it's okay to say no. Being selfish allows you to cut complexity and focus on the work that you want to do. Number four, find complementary collaborators. Being a solo performer doesn't mean you've always have to work alone. Collaborating with other designers across disciplines that are complementary can open up opportunities for larger-scale work without scaling the number of people on your team. This kind of structure can also be ideal to really hone in on what you enjoy working on. For example, when I first started freelancing, I offered branding and web design and development and SEO. Through many projects, I realized that what I really enjoyed was the web design and development. I started to think consciously about how I could focus just on that aspect of a project, and I made connections with brand designers who are responsible for setting the strategy, creative direction, and foundational elements of a brand. Once they've completed the brand work, I jump in to execute the website design and development. They get to do what they love, I get to do what I love, and the client gets a hyper-focused team of creatives that excel at their part of the process. These kind of relationships are often more of a collaboration than an agency structure, and both parties can operate independently. By pairing back my offering and collaborating with other creatives, I can simplify my work to the elements that I excel at. Number five, build a support system. Something I wish I would have done sooner in my independent career is prioritize building a support system. I think of a support system like strong pillars that hold me up and help me be resilient. If one of them is weak, the others can take more of a load, but if none of them are strong, then I can't be strong. My support system looks something like this. Emotional well-being, physical health, community, and necessities. In my first year of freelancing, this support system was pretty non-existent. I thought that I had to do everything and be everything to everyone, and if I wasn't, I was a failure. But building supports in each of these areas has helped me become a stronger person and a better designer. I started counseling to talk through business and personal challenges. I prioritize movement, like running and cycling to take care of my body and prioritize and reinforce that I can do hard things. I started to become more active in the Webflow community online and made connections with other designers for critique and commiseration. And finally, I asked for help at home with things like grocery shopping, cleaning, and the mental load of running a household. I have a fantastic partner who stepped up when I realized that I really needed some more support here, particularly as a solo printer, building a support system gives you greater control of your work and life. The beauty in solo work comes back to my values. Simplicity, flexibility, and control. Staying small is a choice that I've made for now, but I have a long career ahead of me. Nothing is permanent. You work at things until they no longer serve you and then you adapt to the next challenge. Being independent allows me to hone in on my design skills and work at becoming great at what I do. If that ever gets boring, I can reassess. But I hope to continue to have as much fun as I'm having right now. And I hope that with this talk, you can take away some tangible tips to build an independent career and know that growing your career doesn't have to mean growing a team. Thank you.",

    "text": " In this video lesson, we'll cover using a trigger element like this link block to affect the animation of its child elements, the hard icon, and the obscene donut prices. We'll do this in three steps. Building the animation used when hovering in, doing the same for hovering out, then applying it to all the different donut options. Let's start by building the hover in animation. We'll make the link block the trigger. In other words, with our link block selected, we'll make sure that on mouse over, when you hover over this link block, the animation is triggered. We'll play the animation we're about to create when hovering over this link block. Once we go to create this new animation, we'll give it a name, and we can begin animating immediately. Let's start by grabbing our heart and moving it to the left. We're simply making an action or a keyframe which moves the heart to the left. We also want to make sure this is the initial state. That this is how the heart will be positioned when the page loads. Let's do something similar for the price. With the price selected, we can set its initial state just like we set the initial state for our heart, except we're moving it to the right. And all we have to do after that is bring the heart and the price back into view. And we can do this on multiple elements at once. We're simply holding shift and selecting the second element. Then we'll write or control click to duplicate. For that animation, we want to move each of these back to the origin, zero pixels. And if we press the play button right now, it works. It just happens to be boring and linear. For the easing, let's choose something that'll smooth this out. We can also reduce the duration to make the entrance a bit quicker. If we press play now, it's starting to look a lot better. And if we go into preview mode, we can see that upon hovering in, it works exactly as we'd expect, except it only happens once. because we need to define what happens when we hover out. That's hovering in, let's do hovering out. So let's close out of the animation we just built. That was the animation we built for hover. Let's simply duplicate it so we can use it on hover out. And we can do that, we can duplicate it right here. Once that's done, we'll go in and configure. Let's start by renaming it. You can name yours whatever you'd like, no judgment. And essentially for the animation, all we're doing here is trying to move our elements back to their starting positions. So we can delete the last part of the animation we did before, because there's no reason to move anything to the origin. And for these two, we can select both at once and simply switch off initial state. That means they'll animate from wherever they are back to their positions that are set here outside of the link block. We can adjust the easing like we did before. And we can adjust the duration as well. So what does this mean? It means if we go over to preview mode, this works on hovering in. It works on hovering out. But right now, it only works on this one element. Let's apply it to the other donuts. How do we get it to work on the others? First, in both animations, hover in and hover out. With any of the actions or keyframes selected for each element, we can affect the class. This is important because we can also set it to affect children of the trigger. And that means this. When we trigger the link block by hovering over it, it's children, the children of that link block will animate. We want to do this on both animations. That means we'll have to go over and do it on the other one as well. And once we do, we can close out of the animation and make sure we're triggering these animations on all our link blocks, all the donuts. The result, we have an animation which works perfectly as we hover in and out of each link block.",
